## Discussion

### Opening: Flint Reality (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in Flint right now?

**P4:** The water crisis never ended. They say it's fixed but I still don't trust it. Ten years later.

**P10:** I work for the city. We're still dealing with pipe replacements. Still dealing with lawsuits. Still dealing with trauma.

**P1:** The plant is hiring again. EV battery stuff. But it's not what it was in my father's time.

**P2:** The hospital is packed. Flint residents have worse health outcomes. That's the legacy.

**P8:** I work three jobs and still can't afford rent. Flint is supposed to be cheap but wages are low.

**P6:** Our schools are improving but we started from rock bottom. Class sizes are still too big.

**P3:** Saginaw isn't quite as rough but the factory closures hit here too.

**P5:** I drive everywhere for loads. Flint to Detroit, to Grand Rapids. The whole state is uneven.

**P7:** My shop services working people. They're stretched thin. Repairs they can't afford.

**P9:** Construction is busy right now. But project to project, no security.

**MODERATOR:** What do you need from your senator?

**P4:** Someone who fights for us, not forgets us after the cameras leave.

**P1:** Union support. Good trade deals. Not selling us out.

**P2:** Healthcare investment. Mental health especially.

**P10:** Water infrastructure funding. We can't do it alone.

### Lisa Kowalski: One of Us (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Lisa Kowalski represents this area in Congress. What do you think?

**P1:** She's our person. Her dad worked the line at Flint Assembly. She grew up here.

**P4:** She's been to my house. When the water crisis was at its worst, she brought bottled water personally.

**P6:** She's fought for school funding. She shows up at teacher events.

**P2:** At Hurley, the nurses know her. She's pushed for healthcare worker protections.

**P8:** I've seen her at community events. She doesn't act above people.

**P10:** The water crisis - she didn't just talk. She got federal money, pushed the EPA.

**P5:** Teamsters endorse her. That's good enough for me.

**P3:** I don't know her personally but the union people trust her.

**P7:** She's helped small businesses too. Got us connected to SBA programs.

**P9:** Building trades support her. She's for infrastructure.

**MODERATOR:** Anyone have concerns?

**P3:** She's very pro-union. What about non-union workers?

**P7:** Some of her policies are expensive. Who pays?

**P8:** She's been here four years. What's actually better? I'm still broke.

**P1:** Fair point. But imagine how much worse without her fighting.

### Mike DeGroot: Outsider (38:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Mike DeGroot?

**P1:** Never seen him here. He's from Grand Rapids. What does he know about Flint?

**P4:** CEO of what? A consulting company? He's never worked a real job.

**P5:** He's running ads about the economy. But his economy isn't our economy.

**P2:** His healthcare plan is privatization. That means less care for working people.

**P6:** He supports vouchers. That would destroy Flint schools.

**P7:** He talks about small business but he's big business. Different world.

**P9:** He's never held a hammer. Why should I trust him on building things?

**P3:** I tried to be open-minded but he's not speaking to me.

**P8:** Rich guy who wants power. Seen it before.

**P10:** He's against the EPA. The EPA that finally made someone pay attention to our water.

**MODERATOR:** Anyone see any positives?

**P7:** He'd probably lower taxes. That's something.

**P3:** His business experience is real, just not relatable.

**P1:** [Firmly] We don't need a CEO. We need a fighter.

### Water Crisis Legacy (52:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** The water crisis keeps coming up. How does it affect politics here?

**P4:** It's everything. We were poisoned. Children's brains were damaged. Nobody went to jail.

**P10:** The distrust in government starts there. Why should we believe anyone?

**P2:** I see the health effects daily. Developmental delays, lead exposure symptoms.

**P6:** My students are impacted. Some have learning disabilities traced to lead.

**P8:** I grew up drinking that water. I don't know what it did to me.

**P1:** Lisa fought for us on this. That's not nothing.

**P4:** She brought congressional attention. Made Rick Snyder look bad. That felt good.

**P3:** Politicians come and go. The crisis remains.

**MODERATOR:** Does Kowalski's water crisis response affect your vote?

**P4:** 100%. She showed up when others didn't.

**P10:** It proves she actually cares about Flint.

**P2:** It's not just words. She got resources here.

### Economic Anxiety and Hope (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you feeling economically?

**P8:** Desperate. I work constantly and have nothing. Something is wrong with the system.

**P5:** Trucking is okay right now but rates could drop. No stability.

**P9:** Construction is busy but I'm older. How long can I do physical work?

**P1:** I'm lucky - seniority, good union contract. But younger workers are different.

**P7:** Small business is surviving but not thriving.

**P3:** Electricians are in demand but finding work is hustle after hustle.

**P2:** Nurses are burned out and underpaid for what we do.

**P6:** Teachers are leaving the profession. Salaries don't match the stress.

**MODERATOR:** What economic message would resonate?

**P1:** Support for unions. Good wages, benefits, security.

**P8:** Actually do something about rent and groceries. Not just talk.

**P5:** Infrastructure spending creates jobs. Keep doing that.

**P4:** Don't forget Flint. Ever.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Kowalski. Without question.

**P2:** Kowalski. She's shown up for us.

**P3:** Probably Kowalski. The union case is compelling.

**P4:** Kowalski. She earned it during the crisis.

**P5:** Kowalski. Teamsters endorsed.

**P6:** Kowalski. For education.

**P7:** Leaning Kowalski. Wish she was more business-friendly but DeGroot isn't the answer.

**P8:** Kowalski. She at least talks about people like me.

**P9:** Kowalski. Building trades.

**P10:** Kowalski. Water crisis loyalty.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 10. This is our senator.

**P2:** 8.

**P3:** 6.

**P4:** 9. Personal investment.

**P5:** 7.

**P6:** 8.

**P7:** 5.

**P8:** 6. Hoping for real change.
