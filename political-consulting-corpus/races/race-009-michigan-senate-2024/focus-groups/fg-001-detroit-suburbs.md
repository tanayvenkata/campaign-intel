## Discussion

### Opening: Michigan in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in suburban Detroit right now?

**P2:** The auto industry is in a weird place. EV transition is happening but uncertain. My company is investing but also laying off.

**P10:** We supply to the Big Three. Investment is up for EV but traditional jobs are shifting. Winners and losers.

**P1:** Cost of living has gone up. Home values are good but property taxes are brutal.

**P4:** I'm retired from GM. Good pension, good healthcare. But I worry about the younger workers.

**P7:** School funding is always a fight. We're doing okay in Rochester Hills but other districts are struggling.

**P3:** Healthcare system is stressed. Long waits, staff shortages. We're still recovering from COVID burnout.

**P5:** My small business is holding on. Customers are spending but more cautiously.

**P9:** I just bought a condo. Mortgage rate is painful but better than renting forever.

**P6:** Tech scene in Detroit is growing. There's energy here. But housing is getting expensive.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most?

**P1:** Abortion. After Prop 3 we protected it in Michigan but federal matters too.

**P2:** Economy and auto industry. That's Michigan.

**P4:** Cost of living. Inflation hit retirees hard.

**P3:** Healthcare access and costs.

**P5:** Taxes. Don't make it worse.

### Lisa Kowalski: Autoworker's Daughter (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Lisa Kowalski is the Democratic candidate. What do you know about her?

**P2:** Her dad worked at GM Flint. She gets the auto industry from the worker side.

**P6:** She's been good on workers' rights in Congress. UAW loves her.

**P7:** Strong on education. She was a teacher before politics.

**P1:** Her reproductive rights position is clear. That matters.

**P9:** I've seen her ads. She seems genuine, not fake politician.

**P10:** The industry endorsements are interesting. Some executives support her on EV policy.

**P4:** She's liberal but not crazy liberal. Represents Flint, which is real Michigan.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P5:** Is she going to raise taxes? Democrats always want more money.

**P8:** Her spending plans worry me. Where does the money come from?

**P4:** She's pro-union which can be anti-business sometimes.

**P10:** I want to know specifics on EV policy. Supporting transition is vague.

**P3:** She needs a clearer healthcare message.

**MODERATOR:** P4, you voted Trump 2020 but seem open to Kowalski. Why?

**P4:** I'm an auto guy. Her family is auto. DeGroot is some consultant from Grand Rapids. What does he know about making cars?

---

### Mike DeGroot: CEO Candidate (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Mike DeGroot?

**P5:** He's a businessman. Knows how to run things. That could be good.

**P8:** His fiscal message appeals to me. Cutting waste, efficiency.

**P4:** CEO types don't understand regular workers. I've worked under enough of them.

**P2:** He's never been on an assembly line. I don't trust him on auto issues.

**P1:** His abortion position is disqualifying. He's anti-choice despite trying to moderate.

**P6:** He's another rich guy trying to buy a Senate seat.

**P7:** His education policy is vouchers. That would devastate public schools.

**P3:** No healthcare vision that I've heard. Just "market solutions."

**P10:** He's positioned as business-friendly but what's his actual plan for manufacturing?

**P9:** His ads are negative. All attacks on Kowalski, nothing about him.

**MODERATOR:** P5 and P8, you seem more favorable. What appeals?

**P5:** Lower taxes, less regulation. Basic Republican stuff I agree with.

**P8:** Someone with business experience. Not another career politician.

**P4:** [Cutting in] Career politician vs. career CEO. Neither is perfect.

### Auto Industry and Economic Messaging (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's dig into the economic messages.

[Kowalski message]: "Lisa Kowalski grew up watching her father build cars at GM Flint. She knows what it means when a factory closes. She's fought to bring EV manufacturing to Michigan - 10,000 new jobs already. She'll keep fighting for Michigan workers."

**P2:** That's exactly right. She knows the industry.

**P4:** The Flint thing is powerful. Those closures destroyed families.

**P10:** 10,000 jobs is specific. I'd like to verify but it's concrete.

**P6:** Working-class credentials matter.

**P5:** It's a nice story but what about taxpayers?

**P8:** EV investment is fine but who's paying for it?

[DeGroot message]: "Michigan needs a senator who understands business. Mike DeGroot created hundreds of jobs as CEO. He'll cut red tape, lower costs, and bring manufacturing back. Career politicians like Lisa Kowalski just spend your money."

**P8:** Creating jobs as CEO is real experience.

**P5:** Cut red tape resonates with me.

**P4:** [Skeptically] CEOs create jobs by cutting workers. I've seen it.

**P2:** "Career politicians" - she's been in Congress for four years. That's not a career.

**P1:** His ads attack but what would he DO?

**P10:** Manufacturing is already coming back. What's his additional plan?

**MODERATOR:** Which message is more compelling?

[Kowalski: 6. DeGroot: 3. Undecided: 1]

### Abortion as Persistent Issue (68:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Abortion - does it still matter in 2024?

**P1:** Absolutely. One election doesn't secure anything. Need federal protection.

**P9:** Young women are paying attention. This motivates us.

**P3:** Medically, the restrictions in other states are dangerous. We need protection.

**P7:** My students' parents talk about it. It affects families.

**P5:** I'm pro-choice personally but it shouldn't be the only issue.

**P8:** I'm uncomfortable with it as a political weapon. But I get why it matters.

**P4:** My daughters care about it. I listen to them.

**P6:** Any candidate who'd restrict abortion loses my vote automatically.

**P10:** I'm focused on economy but my wife is focused on this. It's a family discussion.

**MODERATOR:** Does Kowalski's position on abortion affect your vote?

**P1:** It's a major factor. Yes.

**P9:** Definitely yes.

**P4:** It makes her more acceptable to my daughters, which matters.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting for Senate?

**P1:** Kowalski. Abortion and she seems competent.

**P2:** Kowalski. Auto industry and union.

**P3:** Kowalski. Healthcare and abortion.

**P4:** Probably Kowalski. Auto background matters. First time voting Democrat for Senate.

**P5:** Leaning DeGroot. Taxes.

**P7:** Kowalski. Education.

**P8:** Probably DeGroot. Fiscal conservatism.

**P9:** Kowalski. Healthcare and abortion.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Auto industry credentials matter** - Kowalski's working-class auto background resonates in Detroit suburbs, even with management types like P4.

2. **P4 (Trump 2020) considering Kowalski** - "Her family is auto. DeGroot is some consultant. What does he know about making cars?"

3. **Abortion remains salient** - Especially for women (P1, P9) but also family influence (P4's daughters).

4. **DeGroot's CEO image is mixed** - Positive for P5/P8 (fiscal), negative for P2/P4 (worker skepticism).

5. **Economic specificity wins** - "10,000 jobs" beats "cut red tape."

### Vote Intent

- **Kowalski:** 7 (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P9, plus P4 crossover)
- **DeGroot:** 2 (P5, P8)
- **Leaning Kowalski:** 1 (P10)

Strong suburban performance.

### Crossover Profile (P4)

- Retired GM manager, Trump 2020, voting Kowalski for first time
- Key: Auto industry identity > party identity
