## Discussion

### Opening: West Michigan in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. West Michigan has been changing politically. What do you see?

**P1:** Grand Rapids used to be reliably Republican. Dutch Reformed, business community. That's shifting.

**P5:** The younger generation is different. More progressive. Less church-connected.

**P3:** I moved from Chicago three years ago. Grand Rapids is vibrant but more conservative than I'm used to.

**P6:** The suburbs are in play now. Women especially after Dobbs.

**P4:** Downtown is definitely more liberal. But Kent County overall is still competitive.

**P7:** Working-class areas like Kentwood are changing. More diverse, more union.

**P2:** Healthcare workers see all of West Michigan. Rural areas are very different from the city.

**P8:** Young professionals are engaged. Protests, organizing. It's a new energy.

**P9:** Auto industry touches here too. Suppliers, logistics. We're connected to Detroit.

**P10:** Forest Hills was solid Republican when I started teaching. Now it's genuinely swing.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter here?

**P1:** Economy. Business climate. Taxes.

**P5:** Moral issues. What kind of society we're building.

**P6:** Abortion. I'm done pretending it doesn't matter.

**P7:** Jobs and wages. Bread and butter.

**P4:** Small business survival. Don't make it harder.

### Mike DeGroot: Hometown Boy (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Mike DeGroot is from West Michigan. Does that matter?

**P1:** He's one of ours. Business community respects him.

**P5:** Dutch-American, Reformed tradition. He speaks our language.

**P4:** His business credentials are real. He's built companies.

**P9:** I've met him at business events. Sharp, competent.

**MODERATOR:** What about his candidacy?

**P1:** He'd be good for the business climate. Fewer regulations.

**P5:** His values align with traditional West Michigan. Life, family.

**P4:** Lower taxes is always attractive for small business.

**P9:** Industry-friendly. He understands supply chains.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P6:** His abortion position is too extreme. I'm pro-life personally but no exceptions? No.

**P2:** Healthcare isn't his strength. He talks markets but markets don't serve everyone.

**P3:** He's a typical corporate Republican. Nothing fresh.

**P7:** He's never been on the union side. Doesn't understand workers.

**P8:** He'd roll back environmental protections. I care about the Great Lakes.

**P10:** His education policy is vouchers. That concerns me.

### Lisa Kowalski: The Outsider Here (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Lisa Kowalski?

**P3:** She's the Democrat. For me, that's enough.

**P8:** Her record on workers' rights is strong. Environment too.

**P7:** Union endorsed. That matters in my household.

**P2:** Healthcare - she's actually got a vision.

**P6:** Abortion - she's clear. Protect reproductive rights.

**P10:** Education funding. She supports public schools.

**P1:** She's from Flint. Does she understand West Michigan?

**P5:** She's liberal. Not aligned with our values.

**P4:** Pro-union often means anti-business. I'm skeptical.

**P9:** I know her EV policy hurts traditional auto. The transition is rough.

**MODERATOR:** Is being from East Michigan a problem?

**P1:** A little. We're different over here.

**P5:** The cultural fit isn't natural.

**P4:** But she'd still be a Michigan senator. She'd have to work with everyone.

**P7:** I don't care where she's from. I care what she'll do.

### Abortion's Impact in West Michigan (52:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** How has the abortion issue affected voting here?

**P6:** Hugely. I'm traditionally Republican but I can't vote for no exceptions. Women die.

**P2:** Medical community is very aware. Restrictions affect patient care.

**P5:** It's a fundamental value. Life matters. I can't compromise on that.

**P1:** Business people try to stay out of social issues but it's unavoidable now.

**P3:** Post-Prop 3, abortion is protected in Michigan. But federal matters too.

**P8:** Young women are mobilized. Every one of my friends cares about this.

**P10:** Suburban moms have moved on this issue. I've watched it happen.

**P4:** I'm pro-choice quietly. Many business owners are.

**P7:** My wife cares more about it than I do. Her vote affects my household.

**MODERATOR:** Does DeGroot's abortion position concern anyone who'd otherwise support him?

**P6:** Yes. Specifically yes. It's why I'm undecided.

**P4:** [Quietly] It gives me pause.

**P9:** I'm not a single-issue voter but his position is hard to defend.

### Economic Crosscurrents (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk economy.

[DeGroot message]: "Mike DeGroot built businesses right here in Grand Rapids. He knows what it takes to create jobs. Lisa Kowalski is a career politician who's never met a payroll."

**P1:** That's fair. She's a politician.

**P4:** Meeting payroll is real. Politicians don't understand.

**P5:** Job creators deserve respect.

**P7:** She's been in office four years. That's not "career."

**P3:** Meeting payroll as a CEO is different from struggling small business.

**P9:** The "career politician" attack is tired.

[Kowalski message]: "Mike DeGroot made millions while laying off workers. Lisa Kowalski fights for Michigan workers - higher wages, better benefits, secure retirements. Who's really on your side?"

**P7:** That's the message. Workers vs. executives.

**P3:** Layoffs while taking bonuses. That's the CEO playbook.

**P8:** Class framing works when it's true.

**P1:** That's unfair. Layoffs are sometimes necessary for survival.

**P4:** This is class warfare rhetoric.

**P5:** Not helpful to pit workers against employers.

**MODERATOR:** Which message resonates more?

[DeGroot: 4. Kowalski: 4. Undecided: 2]

West Michigan is genuinely divided.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** DeGroot. Business community.

**P2:** Kowalski. Healthcare.

**P3:** Kowalski. Obvious choice for me.

**P4:** Undecided. Leaning DeGroot but abortion is an issue.

**P5:** DeGroot. Values.

**P6:** Probably Kowalski. The abortion thing tipped it.

**P7:** Kowalski. Union household.

**P8:** Kowalski. Young professionals.

**P9:** Leaning DeGroot. Industry.

**P10:** Kowalski. Education and abortion.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Kowalski:** 5 (P2, P3, P7, P8, P10) + 1 probable (P6)
- **DeGroot:** 2 (P1, P5) + 1 leaning (P9)
- **Undecided:** 1 (P4)

**This is competitive. Not blowout either way. Abortion is moving suburban voters.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **West Michigan is genuinely competitive** - Not the safe Republican territory it once was.

2. **Abortion is the swing issue** - P6 (traditionally Republican) moving to Kowalski because of DeGroot's position.

3. **DeGroot's local identity helps but isn't decisive** - "One of ours" but not enough to overcome policy concerns.

4. **Class framing works for Kowalski** - "Workers vs. executives" resonates with P7, P3, P8.

5. **Traditional conservatives remain** - P1, P5 are solid DeGroot. Reformed/business base still exists.

### Vote Intent

- **Kowalski:** 5-6
- **DeGroot:** 2-3
- **Undecided:** 1-2

### Swing Profile (P6)

- 38, marketing director, East Grand Rapids, suburban mom
- Traditional Republican lean but moving on abortion
- Quote: "No exceptions? No."
- Key to suburban shift

### Recommendations

1. **Abortion messaging continues** - It's working in suburbs
2. **Don't write off West Michigan** - It's competitive
3. **Economic class framing** - CEO vs. workers lands
4. **DeGroot's local advantage is surmountable** - Policy matters more

### Key Quotes

> "I'm pro-life personally but no exceptions? No." - P6

> "She's from Flint. Does she understand West Michigan?" - P1

> "Her vote affects my household." - P7 (on wife's abortion focus)

> "Grand Rapids used to be reliably Republican... That's shifting." - P1
