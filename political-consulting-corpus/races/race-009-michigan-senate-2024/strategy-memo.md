# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Michigan Senate 2024
**Candidate:** Lisa Kowalski (D)
**Opponent:** Mike DeGroot (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+4.2%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Lisa Kowalski won the open Michigan Senate seat by 4.2 points, outperforming expectations in a presidential year. Three factors delivered victory: (1) working-class auto industry credibility that resonated across the state, (2) abortion as a persistent mobilizing issue in suburban areas, and (3) DeGroot's CEO background becoming a liability rather than asset. Focus groups showed the race turning on authenticity and economic identity - Kowalski's "autoworker's daughter" narrative beat DeGroot's "job creator" frame.

---

## What Worked

### 1. Working-Class Auto Industry Identity

The "autoworker's daughter" frame was devastatingly effective across all three focus groups:

**Detroit suburbs (P4, retired GM manager, Trump 2020):** "Her family is auto. DeGroot is some consultant from Grand Rapids. What does he know about making cars?"

**Flint (P1, UAW 28 years):** "We don't need a CEO. We need a fighter."

This wasn't just union voters. P4 was management, Trump 2020, and still moved by auto industry authenticity.

### 2. Water Crisis Legacy in Flint

Kowalski's response during the Flint water crisis built deep, personal loyalty:

**P4 (Flint):** "She's been to my house. When the water crisis was at its worst, she brought bottled water personally."

**P10 (Flint):** "She didn't just talk. She got federal money, pushed the EPA."

The Flint base was locked at 10-0 with enthusiasm averaging 7.4. This wasn't just support - it was fierce loyalty.

### 3. Abortion Continued to Move Suburbs

Even in conservative West Michigan, abortion was a decisive issue:

**Grand Rapids P6 (traditionally Republican):** "I'm pro-life personally but no exceptions? No."

DeGroot's extreme abortion position cost him persuadable suburban women who might otherwise have voted Republican on economic issues.

### 4. DeGroot's CEO Identity Backfired

The "job creator" frame collapsed:

**Flint P9:** "He's never held a hammer."

**Detroit P4:** "CEOs create jobs by cutting workers. I've seen it."

**Grand Rapids P7:** "He's never been on the union side."

Working-class voters across the state rejected the CEO-as-qualification argument.

## Geographic Performance

### Oakland County (Detroit Suburbs)

- Focus group: 7-2 Kowalski with 1 undecided
- Key dynamic: P4 (Trump 2020, retired GM) voting Kowalski - auto identity transcended partisanship
- Abortion motivated women voters (P1, P9)
- Enthusiasm: 6.8 average

### Flint/Saginaw (Base)

- Focus group: 10-0 Kowalski
- Key dynamic: Water crisis loyalty + union endorsements = locked base
- Even skeptics (P3, P7) came on board
- Enthusiasm: 7.4 average

### Grand Rapids (Swing)

- Focus group: 5-3 Kowalski with 2 undecided/lean
- Key dynamic: Genuinely competitive but abortion moving suburban voters
- DeGroot's home turf wasn't safe
- Enthusiasm: mixed but Kowalski voters motivated

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Business Community Skepticism

Some business owners remained skeptical:

**Grand Rapids P4:** "Pro-union often means anti-business."

Kowalski's working-class identity was perfect for union households but created resistance among small business owners who saw union strength as threatening.

### 2. West Michigan Cultural Fit

Being from Flint was occasionally a liability in Grand Rapids:

**P1 (Grand Rapids):** "She's from Flint. Does she understand West Michigan?"

The regional identity difference required extra effort to overcome.

### 3. Economic Specificity Gap

Some voters wanted more concrete promises:

**Flint P8:** "She's been here four years. What's actually better? I'm still broke."

Even among supporters, there was desire for more tangible, immediate results.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Working-Class Authenticity Wins in Michigan

Kowalski's "autoworker's daughter" identity was more powerful than DeGroot's business credentials. Candidates with genuine working-class backgrounds have a built-in advantage.

### 2. The Flint Water Crisis Still Matters

Ten years later, the crisis shapes political identity. Candidates who were present and helpful have lasting loyalty. Those who weren't can't fake it.

### 3. Abortion Remains Mobilizing

Even after Prop 3 protected abortion in Michigan, the issue drives turnout and shifts votes in suburban areas. It's not going away as a federal issue.

### 4. CEO Identity Is Now Liability

In an era of anti-elite populism, executive credentials don't automatically transfer to political credibility. Working-class voters are skeptical of "job creator" claims.

### 5. West Michigan Is Winnable

Grand Rapids is no longer safe Republican territory. Suburban shift is real. Abortion + education + young professionals = competitive race.

## Crossover Analysis

### P4 Profile (Detroit Suburbs)
- Retired GM manager, Trump 2020
- Voting Kowalski for first time
- Key: "What does he know about making cars?"
- Lesson: Auto industry identity transcends partisanship

### P6 Profile (Grand Rapids)
- Marketing director, traditionally Republican
- Moving to Kowalski on abortion
- Key: "No exceptions? No."
- Lesson: Suburban women are moveable on abortion

## Message Testing Results

### Strongest Kowalski Message:
"Lisa Kowalski grew up watching her father build cars at GM Flint. She knows what it means when a factory closes."

**Why it worked:** Specific, authentic, emotional

### Weakest DeGroot Message:
"Career politicians like Lisa Kowalski just spend your money."

**Why it failed:** She's been in office 4 years - not a "career." Attack felt false.

## Recommendations for Michigan Democrats

1. **Recruit candidates with working-class backgrounds** - Authenticity beats credentials

2. **Maintain Flint relationships** - The crisis created permanent political identity

3. **Keep abortion front and center** - It's still moving suburban voters

4. **Compete in West Michigan** - Grand Rapids is winnable with right candidate and message

5. **Don't concede business vote entirely** - Some business owners are persuadable on specifics

6. **Specificity matters** - "10,000 jobs" beats "fight for workers"

---

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +4.2% (approximately 200,000 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Flint/Saginaw over-performance: +60,000 vs. baseline
- Oakland County suburban shift: +80,000
- Kent County (Grand Rapids) improvement: +30,000
- Outstate losses contained: -30,000 vs. fear

**Coalition held across regions.**
