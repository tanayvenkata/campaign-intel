# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Ohio Senate 2024
**Candidate:** Tim Brennan (D) - Incumbent
**Opponent:** Jim Stanton (R)
**Outcome:** LOSS (-6.2%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Tim Brennan lost his Senate seat after 18 years by 6.2 points. This was not a close race. Three factors combined for defeat: (1) Trump presidential coattails in a presidential year, (2) working-class defection accelerated beyond recovery, and (3) economic messaging that failed to answer "what have you done lately?" Focus groups conducted in September showed clear warning signs that were not adequately addressed. Ohio is no longer a swing state for statewide Democrats.

## The Collapse: What Happened

### 1. Working-Class Defection

The Youngstown focus group was prophetic. P5 (construction, union, voted Brennan twice before) said it clearly:

> "The Democrats had decades to help us. They didn't. They focused on the cities, on minorities, on college kids. We got nothing."

**Final result in Mahoning County:** Brennan -8 vs. his 2018 performance. The union base crumbled.

**Key defector profile:**
- Union members who voted Obama twice, Trump twice, and Brennan for Senate
- When party frustration exceeded personal loyalty to Brennan, they left
- "Democrats assume we'll vote for them" - this resentment was fatal

### 2. "What Have You Done Lately?"

Across all three focus groups, the same attack landed:

**Cleveland suburbs (P4):** "That was 15 years ago. What's he done lately?"

**Columbus (P8):** "The 'what's changed' question is devastating."

**Youngstown (P10):** "18 years. What's different? Nothing."

Our response - CHIPS Act, infrastructure bill, investments coming - was too abstract, too future-oriented, and too complex. Stanton's attack was visceral and present-tense.

### 3. Trump Coattails

Brennan had historically survived by winning split-ticket voters - Trump supporters who respected him personally. In 2024, straight-ticket voting increased dramatically:

**Youngstown P5:** "I'm voting straight ticket for Trump. Down the line."

**Cleveland P10:** "Stanton. Straight ticket for Trump."

The split-ticket path narrowed. Ohio is now a straight-ticket red state in presidential years.

### 4. Columbus Couldn't Compensate

The Columbus focus group showed our best numbers - 9 of 10 supporting Brennan. But:

**P4:** "Columbus alone cannot elect Brennan."

**Average enthusiasm:** 6.3/10 among our supporters

Even where we won, we didn't win big enough or enthusiastically enough to compensate for rural and working-class losses.

## What Failed

### 1. Backwards-Looking Economic Message

Brennan's core economic message was the 2009 auto bailout. This was 15 years ago. Multiple participants asked: "What's he done lately?"

**Problem:** We led with history, not vision. Accomplishments like CHIPS Act and infrastructure were mentioned but not felt. "Investments coming" isn't compelling to people hurting now.

### 2. Failure to Answer Economic Attack

Stanton's attack - "18 years and what's changed? Prices up, jobs gone" - went largely unanswered.

**Message test results:**
- Cleveland suburbs: Stanton message 6, Brennan message 3
- Columbus: Stanton message 5, Brennan message 4
- Youngstown: Stanton message 6, Brennan message 2

Our message lost in every focus group.

### 3. Cultural Disconnect

Participants repeatedly noted that Democrats are seen as the party of "pronouns and climate" while "towns die":

**Cleveland P2:** "They talk about pronouns and climate while our towns die."

**Youngstown P5:** "They focused on the cities, on minorities, on college kids."

Brennan personally was not blamed for this, but his party affiliation was toxic.

### 4. Lordstown Wound Never Closed

The GM Lordstown plant closure hung over the Youngstown discussion:

**P10:** "Fought and lost. Lordstown is closed. Those are the facts."

We never developed a message that acknowledged failure while pointing forward.

## Focus Group Warning Signs Ignored

### Cleveland Suburbs - Warning Signs

- P4 (retired steelworker, voted Brennan before) said he was "probably voting Stanton"
- Final focus group split: 4 Brennan, 6 Stanton/Lean Stanton
- This should have triggered urgent response

### Columbus - Warning Signs

- Enthusiasm averaging only 6.3/10 among Brennan supporters
- P4 predicted loss: "Columbus isn't enough"
- Split-ticket Republican crossovers (P6) at enthusiasm 4

### Youngstown - Warning Signs

- Focus group split: 3 Brennan, 4 Stanton, 3 undecided
- P5's explicit defection explanation should have reoriented messaging
- Even union members (P8) "understand why people are leaving"

## Lessons for Ohio 2026

### 1. Ohio Is No Longer a Swing State

Accept reality. Ohio voted Trump +8 in 2024. Statewide Democrats must run 8+ points ahead of national party to win. That requires a fundamentally different approach.

### 2. Working-Class Messaging Must Be Specific and Present

- Not "I fought for you" - Show tangible, current results
- Not "investments coming" - "X jobs created in Y town"
- Address cost of living directly: "I'll cap [specific thing]"

### 3. Acknowledge Economic Failures Directly

The "I tried my best" message failed. Need: "The system failed you. Here's specifically what I'll change."

### 4. Cultural Positioning Matters

Cannot appear to be "party of the cities." Must actively reject elite associations. Economic populism must be combined with cultural moderation.

### 5. Find the Split-Ticket Voters

P10 (Youngstown) was persuadable: "I might vote Trump and Brennan."

These voters exist. Message: "Vote however you want for president but keep [candidate] fighting for you."

### 6. Turnout in Base Areas Must Be Higher

Columbus enthusiasm of 6.3 was too low. Young professionals, college-educated - must be fired up, not just supportive.

| Youngstown working class | Lost by 12 | 3-4 in focus group |
| Rural Ohio | Lost by 25+ | Not sampled |
| Union households | Lost by 6 | Historic collapse |

## What 2026 Candidate Must Do Differently

### 1. New Face, New Message

Brennan's 18-year record was as much liability as asset. A challenger in 2026 doesn't have that baggage.

### 2. Economic Populism, Not Policy Wonkery

Simple, visceral economic message:
- "They got rich while you got screwed"
- "I'll cap [X] on day one"
- "Fire the lobbyists"

### 3. Show Up in Forgotten Places

Youngstown, Steubenville, Zanesville, Portsmouth - constant presence. Not photo ops. Real engagement, real plans, real follow-through.

### 4. Distance From National Party

The D next to the name is a liability in Ohio. Must create independent brand. "I'll fight Biden if he's wrong for Ohio" - that kind of positioning.

### 5. Own the Trade Issue

Trump wins on trade because Democrats ceded it. "Made in Ohio" isn't Republican or Democrat - it's economic survival. Take it back.

### 6. Address Cultural Issues Without Culture War

Crime, immigration, education - have positions that aren't just "Republican talking points are wrong." Show you've thought about it, you've listened.

## Key Quotes That Lost Us the Race

> "What's actually changed? Steel is still gone. Jobs are still leaving." - P4, Cleveland

> "The Democrats had decades to help us. They didn't." - P5, Youngstown

> "18 years. What's different? Nothing." - P10, Youngstown

> "Columbus alone cannot elect Brennan." - P4, Columbus

> "We're not a swing state anymore. We're red now." - P4, Cleveland

## Conclusion

Tim Brennan's loss was not inevitable - it was the culmination of trends that were visible in focus groups and not adequately addressed. The working class left because they felt left behind. The economic message failed because it was backwards-looking. Ohio shifted because Democrats stopped competing for it.

A 2026 challenger has the advantage of no incumbency baggage but must learn every lesson from this defeat. Economic populism, cultural moderation, physical presence, and simple messaging are the path forward.

Ohio is not lost forever. But recovering it requires abandoning strategies that haven't worked for a decade.
