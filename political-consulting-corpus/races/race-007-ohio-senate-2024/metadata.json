  "notes": "CRITICAL LOSS. Trump coattails in presidential year, combined with economic messaging failure, produced 6.2-point loss for three-term incumbent. Focus groups showed warning signs: working-class defection in Youngstown, suburban slippage in Cleveland, Columbus couldn't compensate. Economic attacks landed and were not adequately countered. Cultural disconnect with rural Ohio growing. Lessons essential for Ohio 2026 challenger strategy."
