## Discussion

### Opening: Mahoning Valley in 2024 (0:00 - 20:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. What's life like in the Valley right now?

**P10:** You want the truth? It's dying. When GM closed Lordstown, it took the soul of this place with it.

**P1:** I'm UAW. I gave my life to that company. Thirty years. Now my pension is safe but my kids have nothing here.

**P5:** The construction jobs are there but they don't pay what the factory jobs did. Adjusted for inflation, I make less than my dad did.

**P6:** Amazon warehouse is hiring. $18 an hour, no union, brutal pace. That's the new economy.

**P2:** I take care of elderly people for $15 an hour. These are vital jobs and we're treated like servants.

**P7:** Retail has been crushed. The malls are dead. Dollar stores everywhere.

**P8:** Electricians still do okay. But fewer big projects than there used to be.

**P9:** I work two jobs and can barely make rent. My mom helps with the kids or I couldn't survive.

**P3:** I drive out of state for good hauls. Ohio doesn't have the freight it used to.

**P4:** I taught for 35 years. Retired with a decent pension. But the young teachers can't stay.

**MODERATOR:** How do you feel about politicians understanding your situation?

**P10:** [Angrily] They don't. None of them. They promise and promise and nothing changes.

**P1:** They come before elections, shake hands, disappear. Every single one.

**P5:** Trump at least talked like he understood. Whether he delivered is another question.

**P6:** Politicians live in a different world. Columbus, Washington - not here.

**P7:** Both parties have failed this area. Democrats AND Republicans.

### Senator Brennan: Broken Loyalty (20:00 - 42:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Brennan has represented Ohio for 18 years, including this region. What do you think?

**P1:** I've voted for Tim every time. He's one of us - autoworker background, union man. But...

**MODERATOR:** But?

**P1:** Lordstown closed on his watch. I know he fought for it. But it closed. They always close.

**P10:** He came here after the announcement. Looked sad. Said the right things. GM still shipped those jobs to Mexico.

**P4:** Tim has been a fighter. He's voted right on labor, on pensions. I still support him.

**P8:** The IBEW endorses him. I'll probably vote for him. But the enthusiasm isn't what it was.

**P3:** What's he actually done? The plants are still closing. The wages are still flat.

**P5:** I voted for him twice. I'm not this time. His party left us behind.

**P2:** I've never voted for him. He's a Democrat. Democrats don't represent my values.

**P6:** He's an old guy from the old economy. That world is gone.

**P7:** I liked him when I was doing better. Now I'm barely surviving and what has he done?

**P9:** I don't have time to follow politics. My life is working and kids. But nothing seems to get better.

**MODERATOR:** P1, P5, P8 - you've voted for Brennan before. Are you supporting him now?

**P1:** [Slowly] Yes. But I'm the last of my kind. My union brothers are going the other way.

**P5:** No. I'm voting for Stanton. Brennan's a good guy but his party isn't.

**P8:** Probably yes. The union says yes. But I get why people are leaving.

### Jim Stanton: Businessman or Bullshitter? (42:00 - 58:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jim Stanton?

**P5:** He's a businessman. Not a politician. He'll run the economy like a business.

**P2:** He's with Trump. Trump gets us. He talks to us like real people.

**P6:** He's promising to bring jobs back. I don't know if he can but at least he's promising.

**P10:** [Sarcastically] Another guy promising to bring jobs back. Heard that before.

**P3:** Car dealerships aren't exactly manufacturing. He sells cars, doesn't make them.

**P4:** He's dangerous. His policies would hurt workers. He's anti-union.

**P8:** He's anti-union for sure. But some people here don't care about unions anymore.

**P1:** Stanton would gut everything we built. Pensions, protections, all of it.

**P7:** He says he'll cut taxes. That sounds good until you realize it means cutting services.

**P9:** I don't know either of them really. They all make promises.

**MODERATOR:** P5, you're voting for Stanton. What convinced you?

**P5:** [Leaning forward] Look - the Democrats had decades to help us. They didn't. They focused on the cities, on minorities, on college kids. We got nothing. Maybe the Republicans will be different. Probably not. But at least they're not taking us for granted.

**P6:** That's exactly it. Taking us for granted. Democrats assume we'll vote for them because we're union or we're working class. We're not automatic anymore.

**P1:** You're making a mistake. The Republicans will screw you worse.

**P5:** Maybe. But I'm done waiting for Democrats to remember we exist.

### Economic Messaging and Resentment (58:00 - 75:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some messages.

[Brennan message]: "Tim Brennan fought to save GM Lordstown. When the company tried to close it, he was in the trenches fighting for workers. He brought the CHIPS Act investment that's creating new jobs across Ohio."

**P10:** Fought and lost. Lordstown is closed. Those are the facts.

**P1:** He did fight. That's true. But the result is what matters.

**P5:** CHIPS Act? What is that? Some factory in Columbus? What about here?

**P8:** The infrastructure stuff is good but it takes years to see results. People are hurting now.

**P4:** At least he's fighting. Stanton hasn't done anything.

**P6:** It sounds like excuse-making. "I tried my best but failed." Is that really the message?

[Stanton message]: "The politicians in Washington got rich while Youngstown got poor. Tim Brennan has been in office 18 years - 18 years of decline. Time to fire the politicians and hire a businessman."

**P5:** That's the message. Exactly right.

**P2:** Fire the politicians. Yes.

**P10:** [Bitterly] He's not wrong. 18 years. What's different? Nothing.

**P3:** Blaming Brennan for global economics is unfair but...

**P7:** But it feels right. That's what matters.

**P1:** It's a lie. Brennan didn't cause the decline. Corporate greed did.

**P8:** You can't explain global economics to people losing their houses.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is stronger?

[Brennan: 2 hands. Stanton: 6 hands. P9 and P3 don't raise hands.]

**P9:** I honestly don't know. They both say words but my life doesn't change.

**P3:** Stanton's message is unfair but effective. That's politics.

### The Trump Factor (75:00 - 83:00)

**MODERATOR:** Trump is on the ballot. How does that affect your Senate vote?

**P5:** I'm voting straight ticket for Trump. Down the line.

**P2:** Same. Trump first, then everyone with him.

**P6:** Trump says things that make sense about trade, about China. The politicians don't.

**P10:** I voted Trump twice. He didn't fix anything either but at least he punched the right people.

**P1:** Trump is a con man who doesn't care about workers. He used us.

**P4:** Absolutely. His tax cuts went to the rich. Working people got nothing.

**P8:** I'm conflicted. I don't love Trump but I don't trust the alternative.

**P7:** I'm exhausted by Trump. But I'm also exhausted by politics in general.

**P3:** Trump coattails will carry Stanton whether he deserves it or not.

**MODERATOR:** Will some of you vote Trump but Brennan for Senate?

**P10:** I might. Split ticket. Trump and Brennan. I've done it before.

**P8:** I'm considering it. Brennan specifically, not Democrats generally.

**P1:** That's how Tim survives. Split-ticket voters.

**P5:** Not me. Straight ticket. The Democrats are the problem.

---

### Closing: Vote Intent (83:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting for Senate?

**P1:** Brennan. He's still union. That's the line.

**P2:** Stanton. Straight Republican.

**P3:** Undecided but leaning Brennan. I don't trust Stanton.

**P4:** Brennan. I'm a Democrat, always will be.

**P5:** Stanton. Time for something different.

**P6:** Stanton. The Democrats had their chance.

**P7:** Undecided. Leaning Stanton I think. Economy is what matters.

**P8:** Brennan. Union endorsement matters. But I understand why people are leaving.

**P9:** I don't know. Probably whoever I think about last before I vote.

**P10:** Trump. And probably Stanton. But maybe Brennan. I'm angry at everyone.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Brennan:** 3 (P1, P4, P8)
- **Leaning Brennan:** 1 (P3)
- **Stanton:** 3 (P2, P5, P6)
- **Leaning Stanton:** 1 (P7)
- **Truly undecided:** 2 (P9, P10)

**This is Brennan's historic base and he's losing it.**

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - CATASTROPHIC WARNING SIGNS

1. **Working-class defection is real and deep** - P5 (union, voted Brennan twice before) is voting Stanton. P6 (warehouse) is gone. P7 is leaning away.

2. **Lordstown is an open wound** - "Fought and lost" is the summary. Good intentions don't count when plants close.

3. **"Democrats had their chance"** - This phrase repeated. Resentment is about party, not just Brennan.

4. **Trump straight-ticket voting** - Presidential coattails will be significant. Stanton benefits from Trump turnout.

5. **Enthusiasm among supporters is low** - Even P1 and P8 (voting Brennan) are defensive, not excited.

6. **Economic messaging failing** - CHIPS Act, infrastructure - abstractions to people in immediate pain.

### Vote Intent

- **Brennan:** 3
- **Leaning Brennan:** 1
- **Stanton:** 3
- **Leaning Stanton:** 1
- **Undecided:** 2

In Mahoning Valley - historically Brennan's strongest region - he's at best tied.

### Critical Defector Profile (P5)

- **Background:** 41, construction, union member, voted Brennan twice, Trump 2020
- **Why defecting:** "His party left us behind." "Democrats assume we'll vote for them." "I'm done waiting."
- **Quote:** "Maybe the Republicans will be different. Probably not. But at least they're not taking us for granted."

### P10: The Split-Ticket Possibility

- **Background:** 60, former GM Lordstown, bitter
- **Status:** May vote Trump/Brennan split. Key for Brennan survival.
- **Quote:** "I'm angry at everyone."

### Recommendations (URGENT - RACE LIKELY LOST)

1. **Acknowledge failure** - "I fought and lost" isn't enough. Need to say "you deserved better."
2. **Lordstown specifically** - Cannot avoid this. Must address directly.
3. **Split-ticket message** - Target P10 types. "Vote for Trump if you want but keep Tim fighting for you."
4. **Show up NOW** - This was September. Valley feels abandoned.

### Key Quotes
