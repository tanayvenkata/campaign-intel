## Discussion

### Opening: Columbus as Island of Growth (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Columbus seems to be thriving while other Ohio cities struggle. What's your perspective?

**P2:** Intel is coming. Amazon, Google, tech is booming here. We're the exception to Ohio's decline story.

**P4:** Columbus has grown while Cleveland and Youngstown shrank. We're becoming a two-Ohio state.

**P1:** The hospital systems here are enormous employers. Healthcare economy is strong.

**P9:** Young people actually want to live here. That's new for Ohio.

**P3:** We're insulated in many ways. Good schools, good jobs, rising home values.

**P6:** It's a bubble though. Drive 30 minutes in any direction and it's a different world.

**P8:** I used to work in manufacturing. The people I knew from that world aren't doing well.

**P7:** Our schools have resources that most Ohio districts can only dream of.

**P5:** The biotech corridor is exciting. But we can't pretend the rest of Ohio shares our success.

**P10:** I see patients from rural Ohio. The health disparities are shocking.

**MODERATOR:** How does that shape your politics?

**P4:** It makes me value candidates who understand both Ohios. Not just one.

**P6:** Democrats think Ohio is Cleveland and Columbus. They ignore everyone else.

**P8:** I'm a swing voter specifically because I've lived in both Ohios. Neither party gets it right.

### Senator Brennan: Appreciation and Anxiety (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** What do you think of Senator Tim Brennan?

**P1:** He's one of the last labor Democrats. I respect his authenticity.

**P3:** His record on reproductive rights is excellent. That's essential right now.

**P4:** He's delivered for Ohio. CHIPS Act, infrastructure, real investments coming.

**P2:** He understands the working-class thing but also supports tech growth. Good balance.

**P7:** His education record is strong. He fights for public schools.

**P9:** He's becoming a symbol. The last Democrat who can win in Ohio.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P8:** Can he actually win this time? The state has shifted. He might be an anachronism.

**P6:** He's too aligned with Biden. And Biden is not popular here.

**P5:** His campaign feels tired. Same message as 2018. World has changed.

**P4:** Honestly? The economy message feels dated. What's the forward vision?

**P1:** His coalition is aging. He needs to rebuild with new voters.

**P10:** He's solid but the enthusiasm isn't there. People will vote for him but not volunteer.

**MODERATOR:** P8, you voted for Biden in 2020 but seem uncertain. What's happening?

**P8:** I left Trump because of January 6th and chaos. But Brennan has been in office forever. Maybe fresh start is needed.

**P6:** I voted Trump 2020 but I'm considering Brennan. Stanton is too MAGA for me.

**P8:** See, we're cross-pressured. Neither side really represents us.

### Jim Stanton: The MAGA Problem (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jim Stanton?

**P3:** He's a Trump clone. Election denial, extreme on abortion, the whole package.

**P5:** He'd sign a national abortion ban in a heartbeat. Disqualifying.

**P1:** His healthcare positions would hurt patients. Gutting ACA, no alternatives.

**P2:** No serious tech policy. Just slogans about bringing manufacturing back.

**P6:** [Carefully] He's too extreme for me. I'm Republican but not MAGA.

**P9:** He's running ads about crime and immigration in Columbus. We don't have those problems.

**P4:** Intellectually empty. "Cut taxes" is not an economic strategy.

**P7:** Vouchers would devastate public schools. He's openly hostile to public education.

**P10:** He opposes basically everything that would improve healthcare access.

**P8:** He's not my kind of Republican. But the "change" message has some pull.

**MODERATOR:** P6, you're a Trump 2020 voter who's not supporting Stanton?

**P6:** Trump in 2020 was different from Trump now. And Stanton is worse - he's Trump without any of the competence claims.

**P8:** Stanton seems like he's just saying what the base wants to hear. No depth.

**P6:** I may vote for Brennan, actually. Never thought I'd say that. But Stanton is too much.

### The Two Ohios Problem (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Several of you have mentioned the gap between Columbus and the rest of Ohio. How does that affect this race?

**P4:** Columbus alone cannot elect Brennan. He needs Cleveland, he needs some rural votes. That's getting harder.

**P6:** Democrats have written off rural Ohio. Those people know it and resent it.

**P8:** I travel for work. The resentment of Columbus out there is real. We're seen as elitist.

**P9:** Is that fair? We pay taxes that fund services everywhere.

**P6:** Fair or not, it's real. And it shows up at the ballot box.

**P3:** Brennan is specifically NOT that kind of Democrat. He's from Cleveland working class.

**P4:** But his party is associated with coastal elites. That's the bind.

**P2:** Ohio's electoral map makes it almost impossible for Democrats now. We're clustered.

**P7:** The state legislature is aggressively gerrymandered. Brennan is fighting against the tide.

**MODERATOR:** What would it take for Democrats to be competitive statewide?

**P4:** Stop talking to Ohio like it's California. Different language, different priorities.

**P6:** Actually show up in small towns. Not just for photo ops.

**P8:** Economic message that doesn't sound condescending.

**P1:** Address the opioid crisis, the despair. Not just policy but recognition.

**P2:** You can't win Ohio from Columbus alone. But that's all Democrats seem to have.

### Message Testing (68:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read some messages.

[Brennan message]: "Tim Brennan has delivered billions in investments for Ohio - the Intel plant, new manufacturing facilities, infrastructure across the state. That's results, not just talk."

**P4:** True and important. But sounds like an accomplishment list, not a vision.

**P2:** The Intel plant is huge. Why isn't that front and center more?

**P1:** Good but technical. "Billions in investments" is abstract for regular people.

**P8:** I'd want to know: what does that mean for my life? Jobs I can get?

**P6:** It's better than what I expected. Concrete achievements help.

**P5:** Needs human element. Who got hired? What changed?

[Stanton message]: "Tim Brennan has been in Washington for 18 years. What's changed? Prices are up. Jobs are gone. Your kids are leaving. Time to send someone who'll actually fight for Ohio families."

**P8:** That hits hard. The "what's changed" question is devastating.

**P4:** It's unfair - Brennan has fought for Ohio. But it's effective.

**P6:** Simple, emotional, blame-oriented. Classic attack ad.

**P3:** It ignores everything Brennan has accomplished.

**P1:** But accomplishments don't matter if people don't feel them.

**P9:** This is the problem. His attacks are visceral; our defense is wonky.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is stronger?

[Brennan: 4 hands. Stanton: 5 hands. P10 abstains.]

**P10:** Neither really speaks to me. Both feel like standard political noise.

### Closing: Vote Intent and Enthusiasm (80:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Brennan. He's delivered and Stanton is extreme.

**P2:** Brennan. Tech and workers together is the right vision.

**P3:** Brennan. Reproductive rights are non-negotiable.

**P4:** Brennan. But I'm worried he's going to lose.

**P5:** Brennan. For abortion rights.

**P6:** Actually... Brennan. Stanton is too MAGA for me.

**P7:** Brennan. For public education.

**P8:** Undecided. Leaning Brennan but not committed.

**P9:** Brennan. Young professionals need Democrats.

**P10:** Brennan. Healthcare policy matters.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 7.

**P2:** 7.

**P3:** 8.

**P4:** 6.

**P5:** 8.

**P6:** 4.

**P7:** 7.

**P8:** 4.

**P9:** 6.

**P10:** 6.

**Average: 6.3**

**MODERATOR:** Final thought - will Brennan win Ohio?

**P4:** I'm worried. Columbus isn't enough.

**P8:** It's going to be close. Could go either way.

**P6:** Stanton might win despite being terrible. That's where we are.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - WARNING SIGNS

1. **Columbus can't compensate** - Even with near-unanimous support here, participants recognize this isn't enough to win Ohio.

2. **Enthusiasm gap** - 6.3 average among college-educated supporters is concerning. P6 and P8 at 4.

3. **Some Republican crossover** - P6 (Trump 2020) planning to vote Brennan because Stanton too extreme. But enthusiasm is 4.

4. **"What's changed?" is devastating** - Even supporters struggled to answer Stanton's attack effectively.

5. **Two Ohios problem acknowledged** - Participants recognize Democrats have lost rural Ohio. No solution offered.

6. **Wonky vs. emotional** - Brennan's accomplishments list doesn't match Stanton's visceral attacks.

### Vote Intent

- **Brennan:** 9
- **Undecided lean Brennan:** 1
- **Enthusiasm range:** 4-8 (average 6.3)

### Key Dynamics

- **P6 (Republican crossover):** Voting Brennan at 4 enthusiasm. Shows ceiling for crossover strategy.
- **P8 (swing voter):** "Undecided, leaning Brennan" but at 4 enthusiasm. May not actually vote.
- **P4 (professor):** Voting Brennan at 6 but predicts loss. "Columbus isn't enough."

### Columbus Bubble Problem

Even educated, engaged Democrats recognize:
- They're in a bubble
- Their votes can't compensate for rural losses
- The state has shifted fundamentally

> "The 'what's changed' question is devastating." - P8
