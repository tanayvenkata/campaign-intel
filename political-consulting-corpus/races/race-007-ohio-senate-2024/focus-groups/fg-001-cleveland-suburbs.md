## Discussion

### Opening: Economic Anxiety in Cuyahoga County (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Let's start with how you're feeling about the economy and your community.

**P4:** I worked at Republic Steel for 35 years before it closed. My pension is okay but my kids can't find what I had. The jobs are gone.

**P2:** Manufacturing is still here but it's different. Fewer workers, more automation. The union doesn't have the power it used to.

**P5:** Everything costs more. Groceries, gas, home repairs. My commission income is down because fewer people can afford houses.

**P8:** I drive for a living. Fuel costs ate into my margins for years. They're better now but I don't trust it to last.

**P1:** Healthcare costs are insane. Even with good insurance, the deductibles, the copays - it adds up fast.

**P7:** I own a small shop. My costs are up 30% from four years ago. I can't raise prices that much or I lose customers.

**P6:** Tech is doing okay but I feel the anxiety around me. This isn't the Cleveland I grew up in.

**MODERATOR:** How would you describe the trajectory?

**P4:** Decline. That's the word. Decline for 40 years.

**P2:** We had one good window - the auto bailout helped. But it didn't last.

**P9:** My students' parents are stressed. More kids on free lunch. Families struggling.

**P10:** People feel less safe too. Not just crime but economic insecurity.

**P3:** Columbus is booming. Cleveland is... maintaining. Barely.

**P5:** People are leaving. My own kids are looking at North Carolina, Texas. Can't blame them.

### Senator Brennan: Has He Delivered? (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Tim Brennan has represented Ohio for 18 years. What do you think of him?

**P4:** I've voted for him every time. He's a union man, a working-class guy. But...

**MODERATOR:** But?

**P4:** But what's actually changed? Steel is still gone. Jobs are still leaving. I believe he fights but I'm not sure he wins.

**P2:** He talks about workers but Democrats nationally don't seem to care about manufacturing. They want green energy and tech.

**P6:** He's delivered some things. Infrastructure bill, some factory investments. But it takes time to see results.

**P1:** I like Tim. He's authentic. His voting record on healthcare is good.

**P3:** He's become almost a nostalgic figure. The last of a kind. That's good and bad.

**P7:** What's his economic plan now? I hear about what he did, not what he'll do.

**P8:** I've never voted for him. He's too far left for me.

**P5:** Same. Democrats are the party of coastal elites, not Ohio workers.

**P9:** He fights for public education. That matters to me.

**P10:** I respect his service but I think Ohio has moved on from his politics.

**MODERATOR:** Those of you who've supported him before - P4, you said "but." What's changed?

**P4:** Everything around him got worse. I'm not blaming him specifically. But at some point... why am I voting for a party that loses Ohio anyway?

**P2:** The Democrats abandoned working people. They talk about pronouns and climate while our towns die.

**P6:** That's not fair. Brennan specifically has been good on workers. Don't blame him for Twitter activists.

**P4:** I don't blame Tim. I just wonder if it matters anymore.

### Jim Stanton: Fresh Alternative? (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jim Stanton, the Republican candidate?

**P5:** He's a businessman. Self-made. Owns car dealerships across Western Ohio. That's real.

**P8:** He's not a politician. I like that. The politicians haven't fixed anything.

**P10:** He's pro-police, tough on crime. That matters to me.

**P2:** He talks about bringing jobs back. Tariffs, made in America. That resonates.

**P3:** He's a Trump guy. That tells me all I need to know.

**P1:** His healthcare positions are terrible. He'd gut the ACA.

**P6:** He has no government experience. Running a car dealership isn't running a state.

**P7:** His business success appeals to me. But some of his social positions are too extreme.

**P9:** He'd be a disaster for public schools. Vouchers drain resources from my classroom.

**P4:** [Slowly] He's saying things that make sense on the economy. Even if he's full of it, at least he's saying them.

**MODERATOR:** P4, you've voted for Brennan before. Are you considering Stanton?

**P4:** [Long pause] Yeah. I'm considering it. I never thought I'd say that about a Republican Senate candidate.

**P2:** Trump made it okay to vote Republican in Ohio. It used to feel like betraying your union. Now? The union betrayed us.

**P8:** Trump's economics are actually closer to old union politics than Biden's. Tariffs, protecting jobs.

**P6:** That's nonsense. Trump's tariffs hurt farmers and consumers.

**P8:** Farmers in Ohio are doing better than factory workers. And consumers got cheap goods while their neighbors lost jobs.

### The Economic Messaging Problem (55:00 - 72:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read some messages and get your reactions.

[Brennan message]: "Tim Brennan saved the auto industry. When the big automakers were about to fail, he fought for the bailout that saved 850,000 jobs across Ohio. Jim Stanton opposed it."

**P4:** That was 15 years ago. What's he done lately?

**P2:** I remember that. It mattered then. But we've had 15 years since and what's new?

**P6:** Infrastructure bill, CHIPS Act - factory investments are coming.

**P5:** I keep hearing about factories "coming." Meanwhile my grocery bill is up 40%.

**P8:** The auto bailout saved union bosses, not workers. Plants still closed.

**P1:** He's been fighting for lower drug costs. That matters.

**P3:** The message is backwards-looking. What's the future vision?

[Stanton message]: "Jim Stanton will cut your taxes, fight inflation, and bring jobs back to Ohio. Career politicians like Tim Brennan have had their chance. Time for a change."

**P5:** Simple. Clear. I understand what he's offering.

**P4:** "Career politician" stings but it's effective.

**P8:** Finally someone who gets it. Cut spending, cut taxes, grow the economy.

**P6:** It's empty. HOW will he bring jobs back? Magic?

**P1:** Cutting taxes doesn't help when I can't afford healthcare.

**P3:** It's nonsense but it sounds good. That's the problem.

**P7:** The simplicity works. Brennan's message is complicated.

**P9:** "Change" is powerful. Even when change might be worse.

**MODERATOR:** Show of hands - whose message is more compelling?

[Stanton's message: 6 hands. Brennan's: 3 hands. P3 doesn't raise hand for either.]

---

### Cultural and Identity Issues (72:00 - 82:00)

**MODERATOR:** Beyond economics, what else matters in this race?

**P10:** Law and order. Democrats seem soft on crime.

**P8:** Immigration. The border is out of control. Ohio is seeing it now too.

**P5:** Parents' rights in education. What's being taught in schools.

**P9:** That's culture war stuff. Stanton is manufacturing issues.

**P2:** Is it manufactured if people actually care about it?

**P4:** [Sighing] Politics used to be about jobs and wages. Now it's about... everything else.

**P6:** Brennan stays focused on economics. That's to his credit.

**P3:** Abortion could help Democrats. Women care about that.

**P1:** It does matter to me. Brennan is right on that.

**P7:** I'm mixed. I want economic focus but some of these social issues are real.

**P10:** Trump's on the ballot. That makes everything different.

**P4:** Trump changed Ohio. We're not a swing state anymore. We're... red now.

### Closing: Vote Intent (82:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote in the Senate race?

**P1:** Brennan. Healthcare and abortion. He's on the right side.

**P2:** Stanton. It's time for a change. The Democrats had their chance.

**P3:** Brennan. Stanton is too extreme even if his message is simple.

**P4:** [Pause] Probably Stanton. I never thought I'd say that. But probably Stanton.

**P5:** Definitely Stanton. Republican across the board.

**P6:** Brennan. I'm a Democrat and he's earned it.

**P7:** Leaning Stanton. Economic message makes sense to me.

**P8:** Stanton. Finally voting for a real Ohio Republican.

**P9:** Brennan. For public education.

**P10:** Stanton. Straight ticket for Trump.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Brennan:** 4 (P1, P3, P6, P9)
- **Stanton:** 5 (P2, P4, P5, P8, P10)
- **Leaning Stanton:** 1 (P7)

**P4 specifically is an Obama-Obama-Trump-Trump voter now voting against Brennan for the first time.**

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - WARNING SIGNS

1. **Working-class defection is real** - P4 (steelworker, union, voted Brennan before) is moving to Stanton. This is catastrophic if representative.

2. **"What have you done lately?"** - Auto bailout was 15 years ago. Message feels dated. Need contemporary wins.

3. **Stanton's simplicity beats Brennan's complexity** - "Cut taxes, bring jobs" is easier to understand than infrastructure and CHIPS Act timelines.

4. **Ohio is no longer a swing state** - P4's observation: "We're red now." Trump coattails in presidential year are devastating.

5. **Cultural issues are cutting Republican** - Immigration, crime, education. Brennan's economic focus isn't enough.

6. **Enthusiasm problem** - Even Brennan supporters (P1, P3) are defensive, not excited.

### Vote Intent

- **Brennan:** 4
- **Stanton:** 5
- **Leaning Stanton:** 1

This is a LOSING focus group. 6-4 in favor of opponent among swing voters.

### Critical Defector Profile (P4)

- **Background:** 62, retired steelworker, union member, Polish-American, Parma
- **Vote history:** Obama 2008, Obama 2012, Trump 2016, Trump 2020, Brennan previous Senate races
- **Why defecting:** "What's actually changed?" Economic despair, party frustration
- **Quote:** "I don't blame Tim. I just wonder if it matters anymore."

### Recommendations (URGENT)

1. **Update economic message** - Auto bailout is ancient history. Need current wins, current plan.
2. **Simplify** - Stanton's "cut taxes, bring jobs" beats complex policy explanations.
3. **Address cultural issues** - Cannot cede crime, immigration, education entirely.
4. **P4 is the race** - Working-class union voters defecting = loss.

### Key Quotes

> "What's actually changed? Steel is still gone. Jobs are still leaving." - P4

> "The Democrats abandoned working people. They talk about pronouns and climate while our towns die." - P2

> "He's saying things that make sense on the economy. Even if he's full of it, at least he's saying them." - P4

> "We're not a swing state anymore. We're red now." - P4
