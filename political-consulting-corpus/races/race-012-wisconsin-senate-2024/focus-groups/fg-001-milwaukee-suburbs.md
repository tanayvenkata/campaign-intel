## Discussion

### Opening: WOW Counties Reality (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in the Milwaukee suburbs?

**P4:** This is the Republican base of Wisconsin. Was, anyway. It's shifting.

**P7:** Great schools, safe communities, good services. That's why we're here.

**P2:** Manufacturing is still important. But it's not what it was. Automation, offshoring.

**P1:** Healthcare industry is growing. Froedtert, Aurora. Big employers.

**P3:** Families move here for schools. But property taxes are high.

**P6:** I commute to Milwaukee. The economy feels strong but uncertain.

**P8:** Small business is challenging. Regulations, labor costs. Surviving, not thriving.

**P5:** As a pharmacist, I see the healthcare cost crisis daily. People can't afford meds.

**P9:** Wauwatosa is changing. More diverse, more young professionals.

**P10:** The suburbs are in play politically. That's new.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter?

**P1:** Healthcare costs. And abortion after the Dobbs chaos.

**P2:** Economy. Taxes. Don't mess up what's working.

**P3:** Abortion. Schools. Democracy.

**P5:** Healthcare access and costs.

### Emily Schroeder: Nurse Background (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Emily Schroeder is the Democratic candidate. What do you know?

**P9:** She's a nurse. State senator from Appleton. Working-class background.

**P1:** The nurse thing is meaningful. She understands healthcare from the patient side.

**P5:** I've seen her talk about prescription drug costs. She gets it.

**P3:** She's been good on abortion rights in the legislature. That matters.

**P6:** I don't know much about her specifically. What's her economic plan?

**P2:** She's a Democrat. Higher taxes, more spending. Standard.

**P4:** She's from Appleton - that's not Madison. Maybe more reasonable.

**P7:** I've seen her ads. Seems like a normal person, not a radical.

**P8:** What's her position on small business? That's what I need to know.

**P10:** She's positioned as moderate. Whether that's real, I'm not sure.

**MODERATOR:** Does her nursing background matter?

**P1:** Yes. Healthcare is personal. She's been there.

**P5:** It gives her credibility. Not just policy talk.

**P3:** It's authentic. You can't fake nursing experience.

### Mark Thompson: Business Executive (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Mark Thompson?

**P2:** Business background. That's valuable. He understands the economy.

**P4:** He's from this area. Milwaukee suburbs. Knows the community.

**P8:** Pro-business is what I need. Less regulation.

**P10:** He's moderate for a Republican. Not a MAGA type.

**P7:** Self-funded. Independent. Not beholden to party bosses.

**P1:** His healthcare positions are vague. What will he actually do?

**P3:** He's dodging on abortion. That tells me everything.

**P5:** Business executives don't understand healthcare from the patient side.

**P6:** His economic message is generic. "Pro-business." What does that mean?

**P9:** He's just another rich guy. Trying to buy a seat.

**MODERATOR:** The business vs. nurse contrast - how does it play?

**P2:** I trust businesspeople on the economy.

**P1:** I trust nurses on healthcare. And healthcare is my priority.

**P5:** Business is about profit. Healthcare should be about people.

**P6:** Depends on what you care about more.

### Healthcare Costs as Battleground (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's test some messages.

[Schroeder message]: "Emily Schroeder spent 15 years as a nurse, watching patients skip medications because of cost. She's fighting to cap prescription drug prices and lower healthcare costs for Wisconsin families. Mark Thompson made millions in business while healthcare costs skyrocketed."

**P1:** That's powerful. The nurse thing is real.

**P5:** Patients skipping medications - I see it every day. She understands.

**P3:** The contrast works. She helped people; he made money.

**P6:** Good message. Specific.

**P2:** It's class warfare. He's not responsible for drug prices.

**P8:** The "made millions" attack is unfair.

[Thompson message]: "Mark Thompson will cut taxes and grow the economy. Emily Schroeder will vote for Biden's big government agenda. Wisconsin needs a businessman, not a politician."

**P2:** Straightforward. I agree with it.

**P4:** Traditional Republican message. Solid.

**P1:** "Big government" is vague. What about healthcare?

**P5:** It doesn't address what I care about.

**P3:** "Businessman, not politician" - he's asking to BE a politician.

**P9:** Generic stuff. Nothing about people's lives.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is stronger?

[Schroeder: 5. Thompson: 3. Neither: 2]

---

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Schroeder. Healthcare is my issue.

**P2:** Thompson. Business and taxes.

**P3:** Schroeder. Abortion and democracy.

**P4:** Leaning Thompson. But less sure than I'd like.

**P5:** Schroeder. Healthcare perspective.

**P6:** Undecided. Probably Schroeder. Healthcare message resonates.

**P7:** Leaning Thompson. But abortion is a problem.

**P8:** Thompson. Pro-business.

**P9:** Schroeder. Obviously.

**P10:** Undecided. Thompson is local but Schroeder's message is better.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Schroeder:** 4 (P1, P3, P5, P9)
- **Thompson:** 2 (P2, P8)
- **Leaning Thompson:** 2 (P4, P7)
- **Undecided/Lean Schroeder:** 2 (P6, P10)

**WOW counties are competitive. Not lost.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Healthcare costs message works** - Schroeder's nurse background + drug price message is landing even in Republican suburbs.

2. **Abortion creating openings** - P1, P3 cite it. P7 (Thompson lean) says "abortion is a problem."

3. **Thompson's business message is generic** - "Pro-business" doesn't address specific concerns.

4. **Not a wipeout either way** - 4-2-4 split shows competitive race.

5. **"Made millions" attack is debatable** - Some see it as unfair, others see it as valid contrast.

### Vote Intent

- **Schroeder:** 4
- **Lean Schroeder:** 2
- **Thompson:** 2
- **Lean Thompson:** 2

Competitive in traditionally Republican territory.

### Key Quotes

> "Healthcare is personal. She's been there." - P1

> "Business executives don't understand healthcare from the patient side." - P5

> "Abortion is a problem" - P7 (on Thompson's weakness)
