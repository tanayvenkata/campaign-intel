## Discussion

### Opening: Fox Valley Economy (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's the Fox Valley economy like?

**P1:** Paper mills used to run this valley. They're closing, consolidating. My mill might be next.

**P9:** I work at what's left of Appvion. We're always wondering if we're next.

**P3:** Manufacturing is changing. More automation, fewer workers. Those who remain need skills.

**P6:** Healthcare is growing but the jobs don't pay what factory jobs paid.

**P2:** ThedaCare is the biggest employer now. Healthcare is the economy.

**P5:** Trucking is okay but fuel costs and inflation hit hard.

**P7:** My hardware store competes with Menards, Home Depot. It's a fight.

**P4:** The valley is in transition. From manufacturing to... something else.

**P8:** Insurance business is steady. People need coverage.

**P10:** The community is strong. Churches, families. But the economy is uncertain.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter?

**P1:** Jobs. Union jobs. Healthcare.

**P6:** Cost of living. Groceries, rent, everything.

**P3:** Economy overall. Good jobs with benefits.

**P5:** Gas prices. Food prices. Basic survival.

### Emily Schroeder: Hometown Candidate (18:00 - 40:00)

**MODERATOR:** Emily Schroeder is from Appleton. What do you know?

**P2:** I've worked with Emily at ThedaCare. She's the real deal. Compassionate, smart.

**P4:** She's state senator for this district. She's delivered on education, healthcare.

**P1:** Union endorsement. That's all I need to know.

**P9:** She comes from a paper mill family. She gets what we're going through.

**P6:** Her healthcare focus matters. As an aide, I see the problems daily.

**P3:** She's local. She knows the Fox Valley isn't Madison.

**P8:** I've seen her at community events. She's genuine. Not a politician type.

**P7:** She's a Democrat. That's my hesitation.

**P10:** [Carefully] I'm Republican but she seems like a good person.

**P5:** The nurse thing is interesting. She's worked real jobs.

**MODERATOR:** Does her being from Appleton matter?

**P4:** Yes. She knows this community. What we need.

**P2:** She's not parachuting in. She lives here. Shops here. Knows people.

**P9:** Paper mill background, nurse, local - that's us.

### Mark Thompson: The Outsider (40:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Mark Thompson?

**P7:** He's a Republican. Pro-business. That appeals to me.

**P10:** He talks about faith and family. That resonates.

**P3:** He's from Milwaukee suburbs. What does he know about the Fox Valley?

**P1:** Business executive. Those are the people closing our mills.

**P5:** He's never been to Kaukauna. What's he going to do for us?

**P6:** His healthcare positions are vague. More "market solutions."

**P2:** He doesn't understand healthcare from the patient side.

**P8:** He's wealthy, self-funding. That's either good or concerning.

**P9:** Executives ship jobs overseas. Why should I trust him?

**P4:** He seems okay but Schroeder is our person.

**MODERATOR:** The local vs. outsider dynamic - how much does it matter?

**P3:** A lot. We're tired of politicians who don't know us.

**P5:** Someone who's been here, worked here - that matters.

**P1:** Thompson is WOW county. That's not the Fox Valley.

### Economic Anxiety and Trust (55:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some messages.

[Schroeder message]: "Emily Schroeder grew up in a paper mill family in Appleton. She knows what it's like when factories close. As a nurse, she fought for patients. As senator, she'll fight for Wisconsin workers."

**P1:** That's our story. Paper mills, working class. She's us.

**P9:** Factory closings are real. She understands.

**P2:** The nurse-to-senator path is authentic.

**P6:** She's fought for patients - I've seen it.

**P7:** Good story. Better than Thompson's.

**P5:** At least she's worked real jobs.

[Thompson message]: "Mark Thompson built businesses and created jobs. He'll cut taxes and red tape to grow the Wisconsin economy. Emily Schroeder is just another Madison liberal."

**P7:** Pro-business message is fine but "Madison liberal" is unfair.

**P10:** She's from Appleton. That attack doesn't land.

**P3:** The "created jobs" thing - what kind of jobs?

**P1:** CEOs create jobs by cutting workers. Seen it.

**P9:** "Madison liberal" when she's from here? Weak.

**P8:** The attack seems off. She's local.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is stronger?

[Schroeder: 7. Thompson: 2. Undecided: 1]

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Schroeder. Union, local, healthcare.

**P2:** Schroeder. I know her. She's the right choice.

**P3:** Schroeder. She understands the valley.

**P4:** Schroeder. Represents us.

**P5:** Probably Schroeder. Cost of living is killing me. She talks about it.

**P6:** Schroeder. Healthcare.

**P7:** Undecided. Leaning Schroeder actually. She's local.

**P8:** Schroeder. Genuine.

**P9:** Schroeder. For my union.

**P10:** [Long pause] Maybe Schroeder. She's a good person even if she's Democrat.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 9.

**P2:** 9.

**P3:** 7.

**P4:** 8.

**P5:** 6.

**P6:** 7.
