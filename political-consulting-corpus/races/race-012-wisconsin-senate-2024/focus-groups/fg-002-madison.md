## Discussion

### Opening: Madison in 2024 (0:00 - 12:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's Madison like politically right now?

**P1:** Blue fortress. Dane County delivers the votes. But we can't do it alone.

**P5:** The progressive community is energized. Abortion, climate, democracy.

**P2:** State workers are mobilized. Years of attacks on unions. We remember.

**P6:** I marched at the Capitol in 2011. That fire hasn't gone out.

**P3:** I moved here for the vibe. Progressive, educated, outdoor culture. It's special.

**P7:** Climate activism is strong here. Youth engagement is high.

**P10:** First time voting in a Senate race. This feels important.

### Emily Schroeder: The Standard-Bearer (12:00 - 30:00)

**MODERATOR:** What do you think of Emily Schroeder?

**P5:** She's exactly what we need. Nurse, labor background, real person.

**P2:** She's championed workers' rights. AFSCME endorses her. That matters.

**P1:** Her policy positions are solid. Climate, healthcare, education.

**P6:** She comes from Appleton - that's swing territory. She knows how to win there.

**P3:** Her healthcare message is compelling. The nurse thing is authentic.

**P7:** Climate positions are good. Not perfect but good.

**P4:** Her healthcare cost proposals are smart. Practical, not just aspirational.

**P9:** She's been to my bookstore. Actually shops here. That's something.

**P8:** Civil liberties record is strong. Voting rights, criminal justice.

**P10:** She represents what Democrats should be. Working-class roots, progressive values.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P1:** I wish she was bolder on some things. But electability matters.

**P7:** Climate could be stronger. But we're not getting everything we want.

**P3:** She's positioned as moderate. I understand why but it's frustrating.

**P2:** No real concerns. She's the champion we need.

**P5:** Very. After Dobbs, after everything - people are ready.

**P1:** Faculty are engaged. Academic freedom concerns, research funding.

**P7:** Climate activists are doing voter registration. Connecting issues.

**P2:** State workers understand the stakes. We've been targets before.

### Thompson: The Opponent (45:00 - 58:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Mark Thompson?

**P8:** He's everything wrong with Republican politics. Businessman buying a seat.

**P2:** Anti-union for sure. His companies have fought organizing.

**P6:** Same playbook as always. Cut taxes for the rich, cut services for everyone else.

**P1:** His education positions would hurt the UW system.

**P3:** Generic Republican. Nothing distinctive about him.

**P7:** Climate denier. Or climate dodger. Either way, unacceptable.

**P4:** Healthcare positions are vague-to-bad.

**P5:** He's from the WOW counties. That's a different Wisconsin.

**P9:** His supporters don't shop at independent bookstores.

**P10:** He represents the past. We need the future.
