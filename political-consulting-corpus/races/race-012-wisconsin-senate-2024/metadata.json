  "notes": "Narrow open-seat win (+2.8%) required different strategy than 2022 Senate loss. Schroeder's working-class authenticity and nurse background resonated. Healthcare costs message landed. Thompson's business background was mixed liability/asset. WOW counties remained competitive. Madison delivered base turnout. Fox Valley manufacturing anxiety provided opening. Learned lessons from 2022: specific economic message over generic populism."
