# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Wisconsin Senate 2024
**Candidate:** Emily Schroeder (D)
**Opponent:** Mark Thompson (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+2.8%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Emily Schroeder won the Wisconsin Senate race by 2.8 points, capturing an open seat in a closely divided state. The victory came from three factors: (1) her working-class authenticity as a nurse and Appleton native, (2) a healthcare costs message that resonated across regions, and (3) Thompson's inability to connect with voters outside the Milwaukee suburbs. This represents an improvement over the 2022 Senate loss, demonstrating that specific economic messages and authentic candidates can win where generic populism failed.

## What Worked

### 1. Working-Class Authenticity

Schroeder's nurse background and Fox Valley roots were powerful:

**Fox Valley P2:** "She's not parachuting in. She lives here. Shops here. Knows people."

**Fox Valley P9:** "Paper mill background, nurse, local - that's us."

This wasn't just biography - it was inoculation against "Madison liberal" attacks. When Thompson tried that attack, the response was immediate: "She's from Appleton. That attack doesn't land." (P10)

### 2. Healthcare Costs as Central Message

The nurse-to-politician narrative connected seamlessly to healthcare cost message:

**WOW Counties P1:** "Healthcare is personal. She's been there."

**WOW Counties P5:** "Business executives don't understand healthcare from the patient side."

The message - "spent 15 years as a nurse, watching patients skip medications because of cost" - was specific, emotional, and difficult to counter.

### 3. Hometown Advantage in Fox Valley

Schroeder won her home region decisively (8-2 in focus group):

**Fox Valley P4:** "She knows this community. What we need."

The Fox Valley, a critical swing region, delivered because Schroeder was genuinely local. Thompson's Milwaukee suburbs base couldn't replicate this.

### 4. Madison Base Turnout

Average enthusiasm in Madison: 9.1/10. The progressive base turned out massively, driven by abortion, democracy concerns, and 2011 union fight memories.

## Learning from 2022

This race specifically addressed the failures of the 2022 Wisconsin Senate race (Karen Kowalski loss):

| 2022 Failure | 2024 Correction |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Generic economic message | Specific healthcare costs message |
| "Populism" that didn't land | Working-class biography that was authentic |
| WOW counties lost badly | WOW counties competitive (4-6 in focus group) |
| Fox Valley skeptical | Fox Valley delivered (8-2 in focus group) |

### Key Difference: Authenticity

The 2022 candidate talked about "fighting for workers" without the biography to support it. Schroeder's 15 years as a nurse, paper mill family background, and Appleton roots made the same message credible.

## Regional Analysis

### WOW Counties (Milwaukee Suburbs)

- Focus group: 4-2 Schroeder with 4 persuadable
- Key dynamics: Healthcare costs opened doors, abortion created problems for Thompson
- Notable: Traditional Republican voters considering crossover on healthcare

**Quote:** "Abortion is a problem" - P7 (on Thompson's weakness)

### Madison (Dane County)

- Focus group: 10-0 Schroeder, 9.1 enthusiasm
- Key dynamics: Base fired up, turnout infrastructure active
- Notable: 2011 Capitol protests still animate the base

**Quote:** "Fighting since 2011" - P6

### Fox Valley (Appleton/Oshkosh)

- Focus group: 8-2 Schroeder
- Key dynamics: Hometown candidate, paper mill identity, healthcare
- Notable: Even Republicans considering crossover (P7, P10)

**Quote:** "She's a good person even if she's Democrat" - P10

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Thompson's Business Message Was Generic

"Pro-business, cut taxes, cut red tape" didn't resonate:

**WOW P6:** "His economic message is generic. 'Pro-business.' What does that mean?"

No specific policies, no connection to daily economic concerns.

### 2. "Madison Liberal" Attack Failed

Thompson tried to nationalize Schroeder but her local roots defeated it:

**Fox Valley P10:** "She's from Appleton. That attack doesn't land."

Being genuinely from a swing region provided inoculation.

## Lessons for Future Wisconsin Races

### 1. Authentic Candidates Beat Messaging

Schroeder's biography made her message credible. You can't fake working-class authenticity.

### 2. Healthcare Costs Is a Winning Issue

Specific, personal, and difficult to counter. Candidates with healthcare backgrounds have built-in advantage.

### 3. Fox Valley Is Key Geography

Appleton, Oshkosh, Green Bay - this manufacturing region is persuadable with the right candidate and message.

### 4. 2011 Still Matters

The union fight left permanent political identities. Mobilizing that memory works.

### 5. WOW Counties Are Competitive, Not Lost

With the right message (healthcare, abortion), even traditionally Republican suburbs are in play.

---

## Message Testing Results

### Winner: Healthcare/Nurse Frame

"Emily Schroeder spent 15 years as a nurse, watching patients skip medications because of cost."

Won message testing 7-2 in Fox Valley, 5-3 in WOW counties.

### Loser: Generic Business Frame

"Mark Thompson will cut taxes and grow the economy."

This generic positioning lost to Schroeder's specific message consistently.

## Recommendations for Wisconsin Democrats

1. **Recruit candidates with working-class backgrounds** - Biography matters. Authenticity can't be manufactured.

2. **Healthcare costs is the economic message** - More specific than "fighting for workers."

3. **Invest in Fox Valley** - This region is persuadable with local candidates and specific messages.

4. **Maintain 2011 infrastructure** - Union networks, Capitol protest alumni - this is a unique Wisconsin asset.

5. **Don't cede WOW counties** - Healthcare and abortion create openings even in traditionally Republican suburbs.

6. **Resist "Madison liberal" framing** - Candidates from outside Madison have natural advantage.

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +2.8% (approximately 90,000 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Dane County (Madison): +100,000 margin
- Fox Valley improvement: +15,000 vs. 2022
- WOW counties reduced losses: +10,000 vs. 2022
- Rural losses: -35,000 vs. statewide

**Coalition was urban base + swing region improvement.**
