## Discussion

### Opening: Arizona's Political Moment (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Arizona has been at the center of political attention since 2020. What's it like living here now?

**P1:** It's exhausting. The 2020 election stuff never ended. The "audits," the accusations, people still arguing about whether Biden won. It's been two years. I want it to stop.

**P4:** I'm a military man. I believe in orderly transfer of power. What happened on January 6th was disgraceful. And some of these candidates still pushing the lies... that's not conservative. That's dangerous.

**P2:** I moved from San Jose three years ago. The politics here are more intense than I expected. But Arizona is genuinely purple now.

**P6:** I've been Republican my whole life. But this new strain - the election denial, the extremism - it's not what I signed up for.

**P3:** I just want someone who's going to focus on normal issues. Schools, roads, water. Not relitigating 2020 forever.

**P8:** I'll be honest - I have concerns about 2020. Not the crazy stuff, but legitimate questions. But I also want to move forward.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most in this governor's race?

**P3:** Abortion. After Dobbs, I need to know where candidates stand.

**P5:** Economy. Cost of living here has exploded. Housing is insane.

**P10:** Water. Everyone ignores it but it's existential. We're running out.

**P8:** Border. It's a real issue that affects this state directly.

**P1:** Democracy itself. Will they respect election results? That's a question I never thought I'd ask.

### Candidate Impressions: Elena Reyes (15:00 - 32:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Elena Reyes. What do you know about her?

**P9:** She was Secretary of State. She oversaw the 2020 election. Despite the pressure, she certified the results because that's what the law required. That took courage.

**P1:** I voted Republican in 2020 but she did her job. McCain Republicans respect that.

**P6:** She's competent. I've seen her speak - she knows policy, she's not a bomb-thrower.

**P4:** Former prosecutor. Military respects prosecutors. They're about rules and evidence.

**P2:** For someone like me who's new here, her experience matters. She knows how Arizona works.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P8:** She's a Democrat. That means open borders, more spending. I'm skeptical.

**P5:** Is she going to raise my taxes? Business owners worry about that.

**P10:** I want to know her water policy specifically. That's the real crisis.

**P3:** Her abortion position is good for me. But will she be extreme on other things?

### Candidate Impressions: Kari Mitchell (32:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Kari Mitchell?

**P8:** I watched her on TV for years. She's articulate, charismatic. She says things a lot of people think.

**P6:** She's an election denier. I can't get past that. If you can't accept election results, you can't be governor.

**P1:** [Firmly] She's disqualifying. January 6th should have been the end for anyone who pushed those lies. It wasn't.

**P4:** She's said she wouldn't have certified 2020. That's essentially saying she'd overturn democracy. I served this country. I can't vote for that.

**P2:** She seems more like a TV personality than a governor. Lots of sizzle, not much substance.

**P3:** I agree with her on some issues but the election stuff is too much. I don't trust her to lose gracefully.

**P5:** She'd be chaos. I run a business. I need stability.

**P7:** She scares me honestly. The way she talks about "enemies" and "rigged elections" - that's authoritarian language.

**P10:** She's entertaining but governing isn't entertainment.

**P9:** She's everything wrong with politics right now. Grievance, conspiracy, division.

**MODERATOR:** P8, you mentioned you liked her. Tell me more.

**P8:** [Pauses] She's tough on the border. She'll fight. But... [longer pause] ...the 2020 stuff does bother me. I just don't know if Reyes will actually secure the border.

### Democracy and Election Integrity (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's dig into the election integrity issue. How important is it?

**P4:** Fundamental. If we can't trust elections, we don't have a country. It's that simple.

**P1:** I'm a Republican who believes Biden won Arizona. The evidence is clear. Anyone saying otherwise is lying or deluded.

**P6:** The "audit" was embarrassing. They found nothing. At some point you accept reality.

**P8:** I want election security. Is that the same as denying results? I don't think so.

**P2:** From outside, watching Arizona's election drama was alarming. Now I live here and it's worse up close.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read a statement: "Elena Reyes defended Arizona's elections when extremists tried to overturn your vote. She certified the results because that's what the evidence demanded, even when she received death threats. Kari Mitchell says she would have refused to certify. Who do you trust to protect your vote?"

**P1:** That's exactly right. Reyes did her job under incredible pressure.

**P4:** Death threats for doing your job. That's where we are. She still did it.

**P6:** The contrast is stark. One believes in democracy, one doesn't.

**P8:** It's effective. Even for me, it makes me think twice.

**P7:** This should be disqualifying. Full stop.

**P10:** Democracy isn't partisan. Or it shouldn't be.

### Economic and Border Issues (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk economy and border.

**P5:** Housing costs have doubled. Small businesses can't find workers who can afford to live here. That's economic.

**P8:** The border is out of control. Fentanyl is killing people. Human trafficking. It's not racist to want security.

**P2:** Cost of living was supposed to be why people moved here. It's catching up to California.

**P3:** Childcare costs are insane. Teachers leaving because they can't afford rent.

**P8:** Why don't Democrats take the border seriously? That's my question.

**P9:** We can have border security AND humane immigration policy. It's not either/or.

**P4:** The border is real but so is our water crisis. We'll all be migrants if we run out of water.

**P10:** Water is the issue no one talks about enough. The Colorado River is dying.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you trust more on the economy?

**P6:** Normally I'd say Republican. But Mitchell doesn't seem to have real economic ideas.

**P5:** Reyes at least has plans. Mitchell has slogans.

**P8:** I'm skeptical of both. But at least Mitchell isn't going to raise my taxes.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Reyes. I'm a McCain Republican. Mitchell is not that tradition.

**P2:** Reyes. Competence matters more than ideology to me.

**P3:** Reyes. Abortion and the democracy stuff.

**P4:** Reyes. I never thought I'd vote Democrat for governor but here we are.

**P5:** Leaning Reyes. Wish she was more pro-business but Mitchell is too chaotic.

**P6:** Probably Reyes. [Sighs] Party loyalty only goes so far.

**P7:** Definitely Reyes. Mitchell is dangerous.

**P8:** Still undecided. Leaning Mitchell on border but the election denial is hard to swallow.

**P9:** Reyes. Easy call.

**P10:** Reyes. Pragmatic choice.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Election denial is disqualifying for McCain Republicans** - P1, P4, P6 are lifelong Republicans voting Democrat because of this issue.

2. **Democracy concern trumps party loyalty** - "If she won't accept results, she can't be governor."

3. **Mitchell's charisma isn't enough** - Entertainment value doesn't translate to governing trust.

4. **Reyes' Secretary of State record is asset** - Certifying under pressure = courage and integrity.

5. **P8 represents persuadable Mitchell voters** - Border focus but troubled by election denial. This is the swing voter.

### Vote Intent

- **Reyes:** 8
- **Leaning Reyes:** 1
- **Undecided (lean Mitchell):** 1

McCain Republicans delivering decisive margin.
