## Discussion

### Opening: Latino Community in Arizona Today (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Gracias por estar aquí. Let's start in whatever language you're comfortable with. What's it like being Latino in Arizona right now?

**P1:** It's home. My family has been here 30 years. We built a life here. But politically? We're always being talked about, not to.

**P3:** The immigration rhetoric is exhausting. I was undocumented as a child. I became a citizen. I teach your children. But to some politicians, I'll always be "illegal."

**P7:** Arizona has changed. We helped flip it in 2020. But there's backlash. The voting restrictions, the rhetoric - they want to push us back.

**P5:** I've lived here my whole life. My parents, my grandparents. We're not new. But every election, someone acts like we don't belong.

**P4:** I'm not political usually. I just want to run my business and take care of my family. But they keep dragging us into their fights.

**P2:** In construction, I work with everybody - white, Black, Latino. On the job site, we're just workers. Politics makes it weird.

**P6:** I'm Cuban-American. Different experience from Mexican-American in some ways. But we all get lumped together.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most to you this election?

**P1:** Economy. My restaurant almost didn't survive COVID. Now costs are killing me. Food prices, labor costs.

**P3:** Education. I'm a teacher. Our schools are underfunded. Class sizes are impossible.

**P7:** Voting rights. They're trying to make it harder for us to vote. That's the foundation.

**P5:** Healthcare. And my grandchildren's future. What kind of state will they inherit?

**P9:** Housing. Home prices have gone crazy. Even as an agent, I can't afford what I'm selling.

**P10:** Climate, honestly. It's 115 degrees for weeks. Water is running out. My generation will live with this.

### Elena Reyes: One of Us? (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Elena Reyes is the Democratic candidate. What do you know about her?

**P7:** She's Mexican-American. From Tucson. Father was a farmworker. She's one of us - genuinely.

**P1:** She was Secretary of State. She defended our votes in 2020. That took courage.

**P3:** She represents what's possible. Daughter of immigrants who became prosecutor, then Secretary of State, now maybe governor.

**P5:** I've seen her at community events. She speaks Spanish. Real Spanish, not politician Spanish.

**P2:** My union is supporting her. They say she'll protect workers.

**P8:** I like that she was a prosecutor. Law and order, but fair. Not crazy.

**MODERATOR:** Does her background matter to you?

**P7:** Yes. Representation matters. When my kids see a Latina governor, that changes what they think is possible.

**P6:** I care more about policy than identity. But she seems competent, which matters more.

**P4:** Look, I've voted Republican before. But her being Latina doesn't automatically get my vote. What's she going to do for my business?

**P9:** Her economic plan matters to me. I want to know about housing, taxes, business environment.

**P1:** She understands small business. She's talked about reducing regulations, supporting Main Street.

**P10:** For my generation, she represents progress. The opposite of the extremism we're seeing.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns about her?

**P4:** Is she too progressive? Will she be tough on the border or just open doors?

**P8:** Some Democrats talk a good game then forget us. Politicians are politicians.

**P6:** I want to see more specifics. Less talk about "fighting extremism," more talk about water policy.

### Kari Mitchell: The Threat (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Kari Mitchell?

**P3:** She's dangerous. She literally says the 2020 election was stolen. That's attacking our votes.

**P7:** She's a TV personality playing at politics. But a dangerous one because she's good at it.

**P1:** I watched her on the news for years. She seemed normal. Now? [Shakes head] What happened?

**P5:** She scares me. The way she talks about immigrants, about the border. She doesn't see us as Americans.

**P2:** Some guys I work with like her. They say she's tough. But tough on who? On us?

**P4:** I'll be honest - she's better on the border than most Democrats. But the election denial thing is too far.

**P8:** I'm a veteran. I defended this country. She'd throw out my vote because she didn't like the result? No.

**P6:** She's an authoritarian in waiting. The rhetoric is textbook.

**P9:** She would be terrible for business. Chaos, uncertainty, national embarrassment. Who wants to invest in that?

**P10:** She represents everything my generation is fighting against. Hate, lies, extremism.

**MODERATOR:** P4, you mentioned border concerns. Tell me more.

**P4:** My family has businesses on both sides. I know the border is complicated. It's not "open" and it's not an "invasion." But Democrats don't always take it seriously enough. That frustrates me.

**P2:** The border is used as a weapon. Both sides use it. Neither actually fixes it.

**P1:** We need practical solutions. Not walls, not open borders. Work visas, legal pathways.

**P7:** Mitchell uses the border to dehumanize us. "Invasion" - that's military language. We're families.

### Turnout and the Latino Vote (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Latino turnout in Arizona has been growing but there's still room. What affects whether people vote?

**P7:** Registration is still an issue. People who could vote aren't registered. Fear, confusion, apathy.

**P3:** For naturalized citizens, the process can be intimidating. They don't know they can vote. Or they're afraid.

**P5:** Young people. My grandkids' friends - some vote, some don't bother. "It doesn't matter."

**P10:** My friends are engaged but not all of them. Some think both parties are the same. They're wrong but I get it.

**P2:** Working people don't have time. If you're working two jobs, when do you vote? Early voting helps.

**P1:** Information. People don't know where to vote, when early voting is, what's on the ballot.

**P8:** Some people are cynical. "Politicians never deliver." Hard to argue with that sometimes.

**MODERATOR:** What would increase Latino turnout?

**P7:** Treating us like voters, not a demographic to be scared of or pandered to.

**P3:** Spanish language outreach that's authentic. Not Google Translate garbage.

**P1:** Showing up in our neighborhoods. Not just before elections. Year-round presence.

**P4:** Actually delivering on promises. If Democrats want our votes, show results.

**P6:** For younger voters, digital engagement. Social media, influencers, creative content.

**P10:** Peer pressure works. If my friends are all voting, I'm voting. Normalize it.

### Message Testing (68:00 - 80:00)

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Identity matters but isn't sufficient** - Reyes' Latina identity is meaningful, especially for women and younger voters, but persuadable voters (P4, P6) want policy substance.

2. **Election defense is powerful** - The 2020 certification message is the strongest across all participants. Even P4 (persuadable) was moved.

3. **Border is nuanced** - Latino voters aren't uniformly "pro-immigration." P4's perspective reflects real complexity. Don't assume.

4. **Mitchell seen as genuine threat** - Not just opponent but existential threat to community. Language like "invasion" is felt personally.

5. **Turnout infrastructure needed** - Registration gaps, information gaps, cynicism. Organization matters.

6. **Economic message needed too** - Can't run only on identity and democracy. Kitchen table issues resonate.

### Vote Intent

- **Reyes:** 9
- **Leaning Reyes:** 1

Average turnout likelihood: 9.5/10 - Very high engagement

### Persuadable Profile (P4)

- **Demographics:** Male, 45, small business owner, border community ties
- **Concerns:** Border security, business environment, skeptical of Democrats on immigration
- **Moved by:** Election defense message, economic substance
- **Message:** Don't take Latino businessmen for granted; they're persuadable to GOP on border

### Key Quotes

> "She defended our votes in 2020. That took courage." - P1

> "When my kids see a Latina governor, that changes what they think is possible." - P7

> "She'd throw out my vote because she didn't like the result? No." - P8

> "Neither party actually fixes [the border]." - P2
