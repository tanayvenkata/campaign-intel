## Discussion

### Opening: Tucson in the Arizona Political Landscape (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Tucson often feels different from Phoenix politically. What's your perspective?

**P4:** Tucson is a blue island. More progressive, more diverse, more Latino. We feel overlooked by Phoenix sometimes.

**P1:** We have different concerns here. Water is existential. The Colorado River is dying. Phoenix keeps growing like there's infinite water.

**P3:** The university makes this a different place. Young people, ideas, activism. It's not Phoenix sprawl culture.

**P7:** As a planner, I see two Arizonas. Phoenix is sprawl, cars, conservative suburbs. Tucson is trying something different.

**P2:** We're closer to the border too. Immigration isn't abstract here. We know people affected by these policies.

**P5:** Solar potential here is incredible. We should be leading on renewable energy. Instead, APS and SRP fight every rooftop installation.

**P9:** I moved here from California. It's affordable, progressive pocket in a red state. But I worry about which direction Arizona goes.

**MODERATOR:** What issues are driving you this election?

**P1:** Water. Without question. We have maybe 20 years at current usage before catastrophe.

**P2:** Climate and abortion. Post-Dobbs, reproductive rights are on the ballot.

**P6:** Healthcare access. Rural Arizona is a desert for healthcare. People drive hours for basic care.

**P8:** Education funding. Arizona is near the bottom nationally. My teachers are leaving for retail jobs.

**P10:** Workers' rights. The gig economy is eroding wages and benefits. Someone needs to fight back.

**P3:** Housing. Even Tucson is becoming unaffordable. Students living in cars.

### Elena Reyes: Hometown Candidate (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Elena Reyes is from Tucson. Does that matter?

**P4:** She's one of us. Tucson values - practical, community-oriented, not Phoenix flash.

**P1:** I've met her at water policy events. She understands the science. That's rare for a politician.

**P2:** Her environmental record is solid. Not perfect but she'll listen.

**P8:** She's fought for education funding. As a principal, that matters to me personally.

**P7:** Her urban planning background - she was a prosecutor but she gets sustainable growth.

**P3:** She came to campus, met with student organizers. Actually listened, took notes. That's not nothing.

**MODERATOR:** What excites you about her candidacy?

**P4:** First Latina governor. For my students, that visibility matters enormously.

**P2:** She defended the 2020 election. That's baseline sanity but we have to acknowledge it.

**P9:** She's unambiguously pro-choice. After Dobbs, that's essential.

**P1:** She's committed to a serious water plan. Colorado River renegotiation, conservation investment.

**P10:** Union endorsements. She's got UNITE HERE, SEIU. Labor trusts her.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P3:** Is she progressive enough? Or will she govern to the middle?

**P5:** Her business policy could be stronger. Arizona needs more than tax incentives.

**P1:** I worry she'll compromise too much on water. Developers have power.

**P6:** She needs a bolder healthcare vision. Medicaid expansion was step one.

**P10:** Sometimes feels like she's running as "not the crazy one" instead of offering vision.

### Kari Mitchell: Existential Threat (35:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** How do you view Kari Mitchell?

**P2:** Dangerous. Full stop. Election denier, climate denier, extremist.

**P3:** She's a fascist. I don't use that word lightly. But the rhetoric, the lies, the authoritarian tendencies.

**P9:** I literally moved here because I thought Arizona was getting better. She represents regression.

**P4:** She would be a disaster for education. Vouchers, book bans, culture wars in classrooms.

**P1:** She doesn't believe in climate change. We're in a water crisis and she doesn't believe in science.

**P5:** She'd kill solar in this state. Fossil fuel interests back her completely.

**P6:** Healthcare would suffer. She opposes everything that helps uninsured Arizonans.

**P8:** Book bans. Attacking teachers. She sees schools as indoctrination centers, not education.

**P7:** She'd push sprawl development with no regard for sustainability. Phoenix mistakes everywhere.

**P10:** Anti-worker. Anti-union. She'd gut labor protections on day one.

**MODERATOR:** Anyone see any appeal in her?

**P5:** She's a skilled communicator. TV background shows. She knows how to frame things.

**P4:** Some people I know like that she's "tough." Wrong about everything but "strong."

**P1:** She taps into real frustrations even though her solutions are garbage.

**P3:** Her appeal is the same as any authoritarian - simple answers to complex problems.

### Water Crisis: The Defining Issue (50:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** P1, you mentioned water several times. Let's dig into that.

**P1:** Lake Mead is at historic lows. Lake Powell nearly hit dead pool. The Colorado River Compact is being renegotiated. Arizona's future depends on these decisions.

**P7:** Tucson has been better about conservation than Phoenix. But we all share the same river.

**P5:** Solar desalination, water recycling - the technology exists. We need political will.

**P3:** It's a climate justice issue. Who suffers when water gets rationed? Not Scottsdale golf courses.

**P2:** Legally, it's a nightmare. Water rights, tribal claims, interstate compact. You need someone who understands it.

**MODERATOR:** Does Reyes understand it?

**P1:** Better than most politicians. She's talked about tier 2 shortages, CAP cuts, agricultural transitions.

**P7:** She's committed to conservation requirements on new development. That's meaningful.

**P2:** She'll negotiate with Nevada and California. That takes skill.

**MODERATOR:** And Mitchell?

**P1:** She's said climate change isn't causing the drought. That's... I don't have words. The science is unambiguous.

**P7:** She'd let developers do whatever they want. More golf courses in the desert.

**P5:** [Gets animated] Look, I'm in solar. I talk to people across the political spectrum. Even Republicans in rural Arizona know the water is disappearing. This isn't partisan. She's just lying.

**P3:** We're going to be climate refugees in our own country if we don't get this right.

### Base Mobilization and Enthusiasm (68:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** How motivated is the progressive base here?

**P3:** Fired up. The Dobbs decision woke people up. Abortion on the ballot in spirit.

**P9:** Women I know are more engaged than ever. We saw our rights taken away.

**P2:** Climate people are engaged. Water activists. Environmental community.

**P10:** Labor is mobilized. We're doing voter contact, workplace conversations.

**P4:** My students are engaged but unevenly. Some see it mattering. Others are cynical.

**MODERATOR:** What's the enthusiasm gap about?

**P8:** Fatigue. It's been constant since 2016. Every election is "most important ever."

**P1:** People want results. They want to vote once and have things fixed. That's not how it works.

**P6:** Healthcare workers are exhausted. COVID burned us out. Now we have to fight politically too?

**P3:** Some leftists think both parties are the same. They're wrong but I understand the frustration.

**MODERATOR:** What would maximize turnout?

**P10:** Concrete promises. "We will do X on day one." Not vague hopes.

**P3:** Youth voter registration. Campus organizing. Meeting people where they are.

**P9:** Abortion messaging. Blunt. Clear. "Your rights are at stake."

**P1:** For my people - environmentalists - water policy specifics. Show you take it seriously.

**P4:** In Latino communities, authentic outreach. Not last-minute pandering.

---

### Closing: Final Thoughts (80:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting and what's your message to the campaign?

**P1:** Reyes. My message: Lead on water. Be bold. This is existential.

**P2:** Reyes. Message: Hold the line on climate and abortion. Don't triangulate.

**P3:** Reyes. Message: Give progressives a reason to be excited, not just scared.

**P4:** Reyes. Message: Show up in South Tucson, in Latino neighborhoods. All year, not just October.

**P5:** Reyes. Message: Green jobs are economic development. Sell it that way.

**P6:** Reyes. Message: Healthcare workers need support. Acknowledge our sacrifice.

**P7:** Reyes. Message: Sustainable development isn't just nice - it's survival.

**P8:** Reyes. Message: Fight for public education. Teachers are leaving.

**P9:** Reyes. Message: Abortion rights clearly, loudly, unapologetically.

**P10:** Reyes. Message: Stand with workers. Reject corporate money.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.
