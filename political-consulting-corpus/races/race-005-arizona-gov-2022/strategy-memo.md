# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Arizona Governor 2022
**Candidate:** Elena Reyes (D)
**Opponent:** Kari Mitchell (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+0.5%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Elena Reyes won the Arizona governorship by 0.5 points - approximately 17,000 votes - in a race that came down to a single question: Will Arizona accept election denialism? McCain Republicans said no. Combined with high Latino turnout and progressive base mobilization in Tucson, this narrow coalition delivered victory. Mitchell's refusal to commit to accepting results and her continued 2020 lies cost her swing voters who might otherwise have supported a Republican.

## What Worked

### 1. Election Defense Frame

The central message - "She defended your vote" - was devastatingly effective. Focus groups showed:

**Maricopa suburbs:**
- McCain Republicans (P1, P4, P6) explicitly cited election denial as disqualifying
- "If she won't accept results, she can't be governor" - P6
- Message testing showed "defender" frame scored highest (8-10 range)

**Latino Phoenix:**
- Naturalized citizens felt their votes were personally attacked
- "She'd throw out my vote because she didn't like the result? No." - P8

**Key execution:**
- Emphasized Reyes' courage under death threats
- Stark contrast: "She certified. Mitchell says she wouldn't have."
- Connected to broader democracy concerns

### 2. McCain Republican Coalition

The Maricopa suburbs focus group revealed a hidden coalition: lifelong Republicans who couldn't vote for election denialism.

**Profile:**
- P1: Healthcare administrator, "never Trump," McCain voter
- P4: Retired Air Force, conservative, "I served this country"
- P6: Financial advisor, traditional Republican

**Key insight:** These weren't suburban moderates who became Democrats. They were conservatives who drew a line at democracy. Message to them: "You can still be Republican and vote for democracy this one time."

### 3. Latino Turnout Strategy

Phoenix Latino focus group showed high engagement when properly mobilized:

**What worked:**
- Representation messaging ("First Latina governor") energized base
- Spanish-language authentic outreach
- Community presence year-round, not just election season
- Church and community organization partnership

**Turnout:** Latino voters delivered Maricopa County. Registration drives and early voting pushes paid off.

### 4. Tucson as Base Anchor

Pima County delivered strong margins. Tucson focus group showed:

- Water policy specifics engaged environmentalists
- Hometown connection mattered
- Abortion rights mobilized women
- Base wanted bold vision but would turn out regardless

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Border Messaging Gap

Latino focus group (P4, P2) revealed frustration:

> "Democrats don't always take [the border] seriously enough."

> "Neither party actually fixes it."

**Problem:** Mitchell attacked on border constantly. Our response was defensive, not substantive. Persuadable Latino voters (small business owners, border community ties) wanted practical solutions, not just rejecting "invasion" rhetoric.

**Learning:** You can't cede border entirely to Republicans when running in a border state. Need substantive position that doesn't alienate progressives but shows seriousness.

### 2. Economic Specifics Lacking

Across all three focus groups, participants wanted more economic substance:

**Maricopa:** "Normally I'd say Republican on economy" - P6
**Phoenix:** "What's she going to do for my business?" - P4
**Tucson:** "Sometimes feels like she's running as 'not the crazy one' instead of offering vision" - P10

**Problem:** Over-reliance on democracy frame meant economic message was generic. "Kitchen table issues" mentioned but not detailed.

### 3. Base Enthusiasm Maintenance

Tucson focus group revealed progressive fatigue:

> "Give progressives a reason to be excited, not just scared." - P3

> "Every election is 'most important ever.'" - P8

**Problem:** Running against an extremist is motivating but not inspiring. Base voters wanted positive vision for Arizona's future, not just preventing nightmare.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Election Denial Is Disqualifying (For Now)

In 2022, refusing to accept 2020 results cost Mitchell persuadable voters. This may not last forever - normalization is real - but for now it's potent.

**Application:** When opponents have election denial baggage, lead with it. Make it the frame.

### 2. McCain Republicans Are a Coalition, Not a Myth

Real Republicans - conservative on policy, committed to democratic norms - exist. They need permission structure to cross over. Message: "This isn't about ideology. It's about democracy."

### 3. Latino Voters Require Year-Round Investment

You can't parachute into Latino communities in October and expect turnout. Authentic, sustained engagement matters. Spanish-language outreach must be genuinely bilingual, not translated.

### 4. Border Requires Real Position

Border state Democrats must have substantive immigration/border policy. "Not as cruel as Republicans" is insufficient. Work visas, asylum reform, practical enforcement - positions that show seriousness without embracing cruelty.

### 5. Water Is Emerging Top Issue

Tucson focus group was prescient. Water scarcity is becoming existential issue in Southwest. Candidates with serious water policy will have advantage.

## Geographic Insights

**Maricopa County:**
- Delivered margin through suburban swing voters
- McCain Republicans in Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, Chandler
- Growing Latino population in West Valley
- Election denial particularly toxic in educated suburbs

**Pima County (Tucson):**
- Base strength but turnout not automatic
- Water policy matters more than state average
- Hometown connection for Reyes was asset
- University population needs registration push

**Border Counties (Yuma, Cochise):**
- Lost but margins matter
- Latino community cross-pressured on border
- Need substantive engagement, not write-off

---

## Opponent Analysis: Kari Mitchell

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional communicator (TV training)
- Connected to MAGA base energy
- Simple, memorable messaging
- Charismatic in person and on camera

**Fatal Weaknesses:**
- Election denial alienated swing voters
- Lacked policy depth
- "Invasion" rhetoric offensive to Latino voters
- Couldn't pivot to general election tone

**Lesson:** Strong primary candidates can be weak general election candidates. Extremism that wins primaries can lose generals - if properly messaged against.

## Recommendations for Future Arizona Races

1. **Maintain McCain Republican outreach** - This coalition is fragile but real. Don't abandon it.

2. **Develop substantive border position** - Cannot cede this issue. Practical reform messaging needed.

3. **Invest in water policy** - First candidate with serious water plan has significant advantage.

4. **Year-round Latino engagement** - Not just turnout but authentic community presence.

5. **Positive vision needed** - Anti-extremism is motivating but not sufficient. What is Arizona becoming?

6. **Suburban women remain key** - Abortion + democracy combination is powerful in educated suburbs.

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +0.5% (approximately 17,000 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Maricopa suburban crossovers: ~8,000 net votes
- Latino turnout above baseline: ~12,000 net votes
- Pima County progressive turnout: ~5,000 net votes
- Lost ground in rural Arizona: ~8,000 net loss

**Without any one coalition piece, we lose.**
