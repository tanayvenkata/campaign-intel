## Discussion

### Opening: Life on the Reservation (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Tell me about life on the reservation right now.

**P1:** We're sovereign nations but we're still at the mercy of federal policy. What happens in Washington affects us directly.

**P3:** Our schools are underfunded. Half my students don't have internet at home. This is 2024.

**P5:** The IHS hospital is struggling. Wait times are months. People die waiting for care.

**P2:** Jobs are scarce on the rez. I have to travel to Billings for construction work. Forty miles each way.

**P7:** My business serves the community but the economy here is fragile. People are poor.

**P6:** Veterans like me rely on the VA. Sullivan specifically has been good on veterans' issues.

**P4:** I run cattle. Same as my father, grandfather. But grazing rights are always under threat.

**P8:** Tribal sovereignty matters more than left or right. Who will respect our treaties?

**P9:** My generation is trying to revitalize culture, fight for land and water rights. Politics feels distant but it's not.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most in this election?

**P1:** Healthcare sovereignty. Let tribes run our own systems.

**P3:** Education funding. Honor the treaty obligations.

**P5:** IHS needs resources. Not promises.

**P6:** Veterans' services and housing.

**P8:** Any federal policy on lands and resources affects us directly.

**P9:** Climate. Water rights. Sacred sites protection.

### Senator Sullivan: Friend to Indian Country? (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Sullivan has represented Montana 18 years. What's your experience with him?

**P1:** He's been good to us. Comes to the reservation regularly. Listens. Takes our calls.

**P6:** As a veteran, his office has helped me navigate the VA. Concrete results.

**P3:** He's pushed for tribal education funding. Whether it passes is another question, but he pushes.

**P8:** Tribally, Sullivan is respected. He doesn't just show up for votes. He's built relationships.

**P4:** He understands land issues. He's a rancher himself. Gets the complexity.

**P7:** His staff has helped businesses access federal programs. They're responsive.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P2:** I don't really know him honestly. What's he done for unemployment here?

**P5:** IHS is still a disaster. Has anything actually changed?

**P9:** He's fine on tribal issues but what about climate? What about MMIW? The bigger picture?

**P1:** He's a Democrat in a Republican state. That limits what he can do.

**P8:** The question is: does it matter who the senator is if the federal government ignores us anyway?

**MODERATOR:** P2, you mentioned not knowing him. Do you usually vote?

**P2:** Sometimes. Depends. Nothing ever changes so... why bother?

**P5:** I've never voted before. This year I might. But I don't know.

**P9:** That's the problem. People here are disengaged. Feel like votes don't count.

### Matt Hansen: Unknown Quantity (38:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Matt Hansen, the Republican?

**P1:** Never met him. Never seen him on the reservation.

**P8:** He has no tribal policy that I've seen. We're invisible to him.

**P3:** Republicans generally are bad for tribal sovereignty. They want to terminate, not support.

**P6:** Some Republicans are okay on veterans' stuff. But overall, not our friends.

**P4:** I'm conservative on some things but Republicans don't respect treaties.

**P7:** Never heard of him before the election. Sullivan I've met. Hansen is a stranger.

**P2:** [Shrugs] What's the difference really? Politicians are politicians.

**P9:** Hansen is worse on everything I care about. Climate, lands, indigenous rights.

**P5:** I don't know either of them well. But one at least shows up here.

**MODERATOR:** If Hansen won, what would change for tribal communities?

**P8:** Probably worse. Republicans historically have been hostile to sovereignty.

**P1:** Less access. Less responsiveness. We'd be lower priority.

**P3:** He'd vote for things that hurt us. Drilling on sacred lands, budget cuts to IHS.

**P4:** Hard to say. Some Republicans surprise you. But I wouldn't bet on it.

### Turnout: The Crucial Question (50:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Native American turnout can be decisive in close Montana races. What affects whether people vote?

**P1:** Distance. The polling places are far. Transportation is a barrier.

**P3:** Registration is complicated. ID requirements are barriers. Montana made it harder.

**P8:** Cynicism. "Nothing changes, why vote?" That's everywhere.

**P2:** Work schedules. If you're working construction in Billings, when do you vote?

**P5:** Young people don't vote. They're not engaged. Politics feels white and distant.

**P9:** Voter suppression is real. They don't want us to vote. That should make us vote more, but...

**P6:** Veterans vote more reliably. We learned civic duty in service.

**P7:** The tribal council encourages voting but can't force it. Has to be personal motivation.

**MODERATOR:** What would increase turnout?

**P3:** More polling locations on reservations. Mobile voting.

**P1:** Tribal Get Out The Vote drives. We do some but need more resources.

**P8:** Candidates actually showing up. Showing they care about our issues.

**P9:** Young people organizing young people. Not lectures from elders.

**P5:** I'd vote if I thought it mattered. Convince me it matters.

**P2:** Same. What's in it for me? Concrete, not promises.

### Message Testing (68:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some messages.

[Sullivan message for tribal voters]: "Jack Sullivan has been a tireless advocate for tribal sovereignty. He's delivered for IHS, for tribal education, for veterans on reservations. He respects treaties and shows up - not just at election time, but all year."

**P1:** That's accurate. He does show up.

**P6:** Veterans' piece matters to me. True.

**P3:** It's good but... where's the big vision? What will change?

**P8:** Standard politician language. True but not inspiring.

**P9:** It's fine. But this is what should be normal, not special.

**P2:** Sounds like words. What's actually happened?

[Question to increase urgency]: "If Matt Hansen wins, IHS funding could be cut. Veterans' programs threatened. Tribal consultation ignored. This election is about protecting what we've built."

**P1:** That's real. The stakes are real.

**P5:** That makes me want to vote. Fear works I guess.

**P6:** Veterans' programs threatened - that's personal for me.

**P8:** Defense message. We're always defending, never advancing.

**P3:** True but depressing. We can never move forward, just hold the line?

**P9:** Climate is missing. Water rights. The existential stuff.

### Closing: Vote Intent and Likelihood (80:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote, and how likely are you to actually vote?

**P1:** Sullivan. Definitely voting. 10.

**P2:** If I vote, probably Sullivan. Likelihood to vote... 5.

**P3:** Sullivan. Voting. 9.

**P4:** Sullivan. Voting. 8.

**P5:** Sullivan I think. Likelihood to vote... 6.

**P6:** Sullivan. Voting for sure. 10. Veterans vote.

**P7:** Sullivan. Voting. 8.

**P8:** Sullivan. Voting. 9.

**P9:** Sullivan. Voting and organizing. 10.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Sullivan:** 9 of 9
- **Hansen:** 0

**But turnout likelihood averages only 8.3 - and P2 and P5 at 5-6 are concerning.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - TURNOUT IS THE RACE

1. **Unanimous Sullivan support** - No one is voting Hansen. The question is whether they vote at all.

2. **Turnout barriers are real** - Distance, ID requirements, cynicism, disengagement. P2 and P5 may not vote.

3. **Sullivan relationship is strong** - 18 years of showing up, delivering, building trust. Hansen is a stranger.

4. **Cynicism is deep** - "What's in it for me?" "Nothing changes." Hard to counter.

5. **Youth are the wildcard** - P9 is engaged and organizing. P5 may or may not vote for the first time.

6. **Fear messaging works but is depressing** - "Protecting what we've built" motivates but doesn't inspire.

### Vote Intent

- **Sullivan:** 9
- **Hansen:** 0

### Turnout Likelihood

- **Definitely voting (8-10):** 6
- **Maybe voting (5-7):** 3

Average: 8.3 - Good but not great.

### Critical Mobilization Targets

- **P2 (construction worker, 34):** "If I vote, probably Sullivan." Likelihood 5. Needs concrete motivation.
- **P5 (healthcare worker, 28):** First-time voter, might vote. Likelihood 6. Needs peer outreach.

### Recommendations

1. **Turnout operation on reservations** - Transportation, ID assistance, early voting push
2. **Youth-to-youth organizing** - P9 type activists reaching P5 type potentials
3. **Fear + hope combination** - What we're defending AND what we're building
4. **Concrete wins, not just relationships** - "IHS funding increased by X" not just "I listen"
5. **Polling location access** - Push for more locations, earlier voting hours

### Key Quotes

> "I'd vote if I thought it mattered. Convince me it matters." - P5

> "Nothing ever changes so... why bother?" - P2

> "He doesn't just show up for votes. He's built relationships." - P8

> "We're always defending, never advancing." - P8
