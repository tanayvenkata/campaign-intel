## Discussion

### Opening: Rural Montana Reality (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for making time. Tell me about life in rural Montana today.

**P1:** It's hard. Cattle prices are volatile, input costs are insane, and the weather's getting more extreme. Every year is a fight.

**P6:** I'm 35, took over the family place. My grandparents had an easier time of it. We're barely hanging on some years.

**P3:** Wheat prices are okay but fuel, fertilizer, equipment - costs have doubled in ten years. Margins are razor thin.

**P2:** The community is shrinking. Young people leave. The school is half what it was when our kids were there.

**P5:** I drive 200 miles some days to see animals. The distances out here are hard for people to understand.

**P7:** At the post office I see who's left. Fewer ranches, fewer families. It's quiet.

**P4:** When I was ranching actively, there were five families on this road. Now it's two. The land consolidated.

**P8:** My business depends on these ranches. Fewer ranches, fewer customers. Simple math.

**MODERATOR:** What do you need from government?

**P1:** Stay out of our way mostly. But also - fair trade policies, reasonable regulations, infrastructure.

**P3:** Water rights that make sense. The Forest Service and BLM need to understand agriculture.

**P6:** Internet. We still have terrible internet. Hard to run a modern business without it.

**P5:** Rural healthcare. The nearest hospital is 90 miles. That's life or death.

**P8:** Don't make it harder to do business. That's all I ask.

### Senator Sullivan: "He's One of Us, But..." (18:00 - 40:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Sullivan is a rancher from Big Sandy. What do you think of him?

**P1:** I've known Jack 30 years. He's helped me personally with BLM issues, water rights. Good man.

**P4:** Jack's the real deal. Fifth-generation like me. Understands the land, the work.

**P2:** His office saved us when we had a disaster loan problem. Responded in two days.

**P3:** He's gotten things done for ag. The farm bill, disaster assistance. He works across the aisle.

**P5:** For rural healthcare, he's been a fighter. Telehealth expansion, rural hospital funding.

**P7:** Everyone in town knows Jack. He comes through, stops at the diner, talks to people. Not just at election time.

**MODERATOR:** Sounds like strong support. Any concerns?

**P1:** [Long silence] He's a Democrat. That's the concern.

**P4:** I've voted for Jack three times. This time... I don't know.

**P6:** The national party is insane. Guns, immigration, climate policy. Jack isn't that, but he's with them.

**P8:** He votes with Biden 80% of the time or whatever. At some point, that matters.

**P3:** I split my ticket last time. Trump and Jack. Not sure I can this time.

**P2:** It's gotten so partisan. Everything is a war now. Jack gets dragged into it.

**P7:** The ads against him are brutal. "Radical left." I know that's not Jack, but...

**MODERATOR:** P4, you've voted Sullivan three times. What's different now?

**P4:** [Sighing] I'm 71. I remember when parties weren't blood enemies. Now... if I vote for Jack, I'm helping the Democrats. I just can't do that anymore.

**P1:** It breaks my heart. Jack is a good man. But his party isn't.

### Matt Hansen: The Alternative (40:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Matt Hansen?

**P4:** I don't know him. He's the Republican.

**P6:** He's Navy, served the country. Auditor is boring but at least not corrupt.

**P8:** He's local. Knows Montana. Better than some outsider.

**P1:** Does he understand ranching? I doubt it. He's from Helena.

**P3:** He says the right things about regulation, about energy. Whether he means it, who knows.

**P5:** His healthcare policy is "market solutions." That doesn't work in rural areas.

**P2:** I've never met him. Jack I've met a dozen times.

**P7:** He's new. No track record. But maybe new blood is what we need.

**MODERATOR:** If you're considering Hansen over Sullivan, is it Hansen you're voting FOR or Democrats you're voting AGAINST?

**P4:** Voting against the Democrats. Hansen is... fine. But it's about the party.

**P1:** Same. I don't particularly want Hansen. I just can't keep voting for Jack's party.

**P6:** That's honest. Hansen isn't special. He's just not a Democrat.

**P3:** At some point you have to send a message. Montana isn't California.

---

### The Party Problem (55:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's dig into this. What specifically about the Democratic Party concerns you?

**P1:** Guns. Every Democrat wants to take our guns. I know Jack votes right on that, but his party doesn't.

**P6:** Climate. They want to shut down every oil and gas operation, every coal plant. That's Montana jobs.

**P4:** Immigration. Open borders, sanctuary cities. This isn't a border state but the chaos affects everyone.

**P8:** They hate small business. Regulations, taxes, green mandates. It's death by a thousand cuts.

**P3:** They look down on us. We're "flyover country." They think we're stupid.

**P2:** Cultural stuff too. What they teach in schools, the gender stuff. It's not Montana.

**P7:** I'm not as political as some here, but I see it. Democrats are the city party, not the rural party.

**MODERATOR:** Jack has voted against his party on many of these issues. Does that matter?

**P1:** It matters. That's why I've voted for him before. But...

**P4:** But he still caucuses with them. He gives them the majority. On the big votes, he's with them.

**P6:** He can't be independent forever. At some point, you are what you vote with.

**P5:** I think people are being unfair to Jack specifically. But I understand the frustration.

**P3:** It's not about Jack. It's about sending a message. Democrats need to lose Montana completely.

---

### Personal vs. Partisan (70:00 - 82:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read some messages.

[Sullivan message]: "Jack Sullivan isn't a party man - he's a Montana man. He's fought his own party on guns, on energy, on taxes. He's rancher first, senator second. Montana trusts Jack because Jack is Montana."

**P1:** That's true. Every word of it. [Pauses] And I might still not vote for him.

**P4:** Beautiful message. Doesn't change the party problem.

**P2:** That's our Jack. Wish it was enough.

**P7:** If I was undecided, this would help.

**P6:** I believe it. But the country is too divided. Jack's party is the problem.

[Hansen message]: "Matt Hansen will vote Montana values every time. No party pressure. No DC games. Just Montana first."

**P4:** Simple. I don't know if it's true, but it's simple.

**P6:** "Montana values" is code for "not Democrats." And I'm okay with that.

**P3:** It's empty but it lands. Sometimes you just want to vote against the other side.

**P5:** It's a nothing message. He has no record.

**P8:** Both parties do this. "Values." Means nothing.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is more persuasive?

[Sullivan: 3. Hansen: 3. Neither: 2.]

---

### Closing: Vote Intent (82:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** [Long pause] Probably Hansen. God help me, probably Hansen.

**P2:** Sullivan. I know Jack. I don't know Hansen.

**P3:** Hansen. Time to send a message.

**P4:** Hansen. For the first time ever, straight Republican.

**P5:** Sullivan. Healthcare matters more than party.

**P6:** Hansen. The party thing is just too much now.

**P7:** Undecided. Maybe Sullivan. Maybe skip that race entirely.

**P8:** Hansen. Business community is going Republican.

**MODERATOR:** For those voting Sullivan, enthusiasm 1-10?

**P2:** 6.

**P5:** 5.

**P7:** 3 (if I vote for him).

**MODERATOR:** For Hansen voters?

**P1:** 4. I'm not excited. Just decided.

**P3:** 6.

**P4:** 5.

**P6:** 5.

**P8:** 6.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Sullivan:** 2 definite (P2, P5)
- **Hansen:** 5 (P1, P3, P4, P6, P8)
- **Undecided/Skip:** 1 (P7)

**This is catastrophic. Rural Montana, Sullivan's base, is defecting 5-2.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - CATASTROPHIC WARNING

1. **Personal relationship isn't enough** - P1 has known Sullivan 30 years, Sullivan helped him personally. Still voting Hansen.

2. **Party over person is complete** - "I'm not voting FOR Hansen. I'm voting AGAINST Democrats."

3. **Cultural disconnect is existential** - Guns, climate, immigration, "they look down on us." Party brand is toxic.

4. **"Send a message" logic** - P3: "Montana isn't California." Participants want Democrats to lose Montana completely.

5. **Low enthusiasm for both** - Hansen voters averaging 5.2. They don't WANT Hansen; they want NOT-Democrat.

### Vote Intent

- **Sullivan:** 2
- **Hansen:** 5
- **Undecided:** 1

In rural Montana, among people who know Sullivan personally, he's losing 5-2. Race is unwinnable.

### Critical Defector Profile (P1)

- **Background:** 62, cattle rancher, 4,000 acres, known Sullivan 30 years
- **Sullivan help:** "Helped me personally with BLM issues, water rights"
- **Still defecting:** "He's a Democrat. That's the concern."
- **Quote:** "Jack is a good man. But his party isn't."

### The P4 Story

- **Background:** 71, retired rancher, voted Sullivan three times
- **Now:** Voting straight Republican for first time ever
- **Quote:** "It breaks my heart. Jack is a good man."

### Recommendations (Limited Impact Expected)

1. **Depoliticize completely** - Run as individual, not Democrat
2. **Local validator blitz** - Ranchers, sheriffs, local figures
3. **Accept rural loss** - Focus on winning margins in cities
4. **Long-term party work** - This isn't a Sullivan problem. It's a Democrat problem.

### Key Quotes

> "Jack is a good man. But his party isn't." - P1

> "I've voted for Jack three times. This time... I don't know." - P4

> "It's not about Jack. It's about sending a message." - P3

> "At some point, you are what you vote with." - P6
