## Discussion

### Opening: Montana in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in Montana right now?

**P7:** Changing too fast. People from California, Seattle, Texas - they're driving up land prices. Ranching families can't compete.

**P6:** I'm one of those transplants. I came for the outdoors, the space. But I understand the resentment.

**P1:** Cost of living is insane. Billings used to be affordable. Now rent is crazy.

**P3:** Energy sector is doing well. Oil and gas pays the bills. But they keep trying to shut us down.

**P4:** Downtown is booming with new restaurants, shops. But my employees can't afford to live here.

**P5:** I'm retired on a fixed income. Property taxes keep going up. Hard to stay in my own home.

**P2:** Healthcare system is stressed. We serve a huge rural area. Not enough providers.

**P8:** I see patients from all over eastern Montana. The distances are enormous. Healthcare access is a crisis.

**P9:** Business is good. People are buying trucks, SUVs. Montana is growing.

**P10:** The outdoor culture is why I'm here. But I'm worried about public lands getting sold off.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most to you?

**P7:** Public lands. Keep them public. Period.

**P3:** Energy jobs. Don't destroy our economy for climate policy.

**P10:** Climate and the environment. Smoke season gets worse every year.

**P1:** Jobs that pay well. Good benefits. Union representation.

**P4:** Cost of living. Housing especially.

### Senator Sullivan: The Personal Brand (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Jack Sullivan has been in office 18 years. What do you think of him?

**P5:** Jack is Montana. Rancher, straight shooter, helps everyone regardless of party.

**P1:** I've met him twice. He remembered my name the second time. That's something.

**P7:** I'm conservative but I've voted for Jack every time. He's not a typical Democrat.

**P4:** His constituent service is legendary. My aunt had a VA problem, his office fixed it in a week.

**P2:** He's delivered for Montana. Infrastructure, veterans' services, rural healthcare.

**P8:** I don't follow politics closely but I know Jack is responsive. People around here respect him.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P3:** He's still a Democrat. At the end of the day, he votes with them on big things.

**P9:** Jack's fine but his party isn't. Harris, Biden, the national Democrats - they don't represent Montana.

**P6:** I wish he was more progressive honestly. He's very conservative for a Democrat.

**P10:** He's been good on public lands. But I want more on climate.

**P7:** [Slowly] I like Jack personally. But the party thing is getting harder to overlook.

**P4:** I'm worried the national party drags him down even though he's not like them.

### Matt Hansen: The Republican (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Matt Hansen?

**P9:** He's Montana. Navy veteran, state auditor, knows the state.

**P3:** He'll vote for energy jobs, against the climate stuff that kills our economy.

**P7:** I know his family. Good people. He's not a crazy MAGA type.

**P5:** He has no record to speak of. State auditor is a nothing job.

**P1:** He's never done anything for workers. At least Jack has a labor record.

**P2:** His healthcare positions are vague. He says "choice" but what does that mean?

**P6:** He's a Trump guy pretending to be moderate. Look at his endorsements.

**P10:** He'd sell our public lands to the highest bidder.

**P8:** I don't know much about him honestly. He's the Republican, I know that.

**P4:** He's younger, fresher. Maybe it's time for a change.

**MODERATOR:** P7, you've voted Sullivan before. Are you reconsidering?

**P7:** [Long pause] Yeah. Trump's going to carry Montana by 20 points. Maybe it's time to have both senators on the same team.

**P9:** Exactly. Divided representation doesn't work anymore.

**P5:** That's tribalism. Jack delivers regardless of party.

**P7:** I know. But the country is divided. Maybe Montana should pick a side.

### The Nationalization Problem (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Some of you have mentioned national politics. How does that affect this race?

**P9:** You can't separate Jack from his party. He's a Democrat. Democrats are for things Montana hates.

**P3:** Guns. Immigration. Climate policy that kills our jobs. That's what Democrats stand for.

**P5:** Jack has voted against his party plenty of times. He's independent.

**P6:** But will he support whoever's president if it's a Democrat? Probably.

**P7:** The committee assignments, the leadership votes - he's still a Democrat vote when it counts.

**P1:** Jack is specifically good on labor. That's not a national party thing. That's him.

**P4:** Every ad I see ties Jack to Pelosi, to Biden. Whether it's fair or not, it sticks.

**P8:** I'm tired of everything being about national politics. What about Montana?

**P10:** Hansen would just vote with McConnell on everything. At least Jack thinks for himself.

**P9:** That's the trade. Jack sometimes votes wrong. Hansen would always vote our way.

**MODERATOR:** Show of hands - is Jack's party more important than Jack himself?

[5 hands raised: P3, P6, P7, P9, P4 - mostly saying yes, party matters more]

**P7:** I didn't want to raise my hand. But honestly... yeah. It's the party now.

### Message Testing (68:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some messages.

[Sullivan message]: "Jack Sullivan is Montana through and through. Fifth-generation rancher, proven independent voice. He's stood up to both parties to protect Montana jobs, Montana lands, and Montana families."

**P5:** That's Jack. Authentic.

**P1:** The independent thing is important. He's not a puppet.

**P7:** I believe it. But does it matter anymore?

**P4:** Good message but I've heard it before. 18 years of the same message.

**P3:** Actions matter more than words. He still votes Democrat most of the time.

**P9:** "Stood up to both parties" - but he's still a Democrat.

[Hansen message]: "Montana needs a senator who votes Montana values, not San Francisco values. Matt Hansen will always put Montana first, not the radical left agenda."

**P3:** That's direct. I like it.

**P9:** San Francisco values - exactly what we're voting against.

**P7:** It's simplistic but... not wrong.

**P5:** This is stupid. Jack IS Montana values.

**P10:** Classic culture war garbage.

**P6:** It works on people, I can see that. Even if it's misleading.

**P4:** Unfortunately effective.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is more compelling?

[Sullivan: 4. Hansen: 4. Abstaining: 2.]

**P8:** Neither really. I'm just tired of all of it.

### Closing: Vote Intent (80:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Sullivan. Union record matters.

**P2:** Sullivan. Healthcare and services.

**P3:** Hansen. Party alignment.

**P4:** Undecided. Leaning Sullivan but unsure.

**P5:** Sullivan. He's earned it.

**P6:** Sullivan. But wish he was more progressive.

**P7:** [Sighing] Probably Hansen. I can't believe I'm saying it. But probably Hansen.

**P8:** Sullivan. I know he responds to constituents.

**P9:** Hansen. Straight ticket.

**P10:** Sullivan. Public lands.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 7.

**P2:** 6.

**P3:** 8.

**P4:** 4.

**P5:** 7.

**P6:** 5.

**P7:** 3.

**P8:** 5.

**P9:** 8.

**P10:** 6.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Sullivan:** 5 (P1, P2, P5, P8, P10)
- **Hansen:** 3 (P3, P7, P9)
- **Leaning Sullivan:** 1 (P4)
- **Progressive reluctant:** 1 (P6)

**Average Sullivan enthusiasm: 5.8/10 - concerning.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes - WARNING SIGNS

1. **P7 defection is critical** - Conservative who voted Sullivan three times is moving to Hansen. "I can't believe I'm saying it."

2. **Nationalization is winning** - 5 of 10 said party matters more than candidate. Sullivan's personal brand can't overcome.

3. **"San Francisco values" attack is working** - Even those who reject it acknowledge it's effective.

4. **Enthusiasm gap among supporters** - Sullivan voters averaging 5.8. P7 (defector) at 3 on Hansen.

5. **Transplant tension** - P6 represents coastal refugees. Valuable votes but also symbol of what conservatives resent.

6. **Fatigue factor** - P8: "I'm tired of all of it." Low-information voters may just stay home or go with the wave.

### Vote Intent

- **Sullivan:** 5
- **Leaning Sullivan:** 2
- **Hansen:** 3

This is better than statewide polling but enthusiasm is too low.

### Critical Defector Profile (P7)

- **Background:** 41, rancher, conservative, voted Sullivan three times before
- **Why defecting:** "Trump's going to carry Montana by 20 points. Maybe it's time to have both senators on the same team."
- **Enthusiasm:** 3 for Hansen - voting against party, not for candidate
- **Quote:** "I like Jack personally. But the party thing is getting harder to overlook."

### Recommendations

1. **Depoliticize** - Run against Washington, not as Democrat
2. **Local stories** - Constituent service moments, not policy debates
3. **Public lands heavily** - Cross-partisan issue that matters here
4. **Split-ticket permission** - "Vote for whoever for president but keep Jack working for Montana"
