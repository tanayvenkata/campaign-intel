# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Montana Senate 2024
**Candidate:** Jack Sullivan (D) - Incumbent
**Opponent:** Matt Hansen (R)
**Outcome:** LOSS (-4.8%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

## Executive Summary

Jack Sullivan lost his Senate seat after 18 years by 4.8 points. This was a personal tragedy for a candidate with legendary constituent service, deep relationships across Montana, and genuine bipartisan respect. None of it was enough. Three factors combined for defeat: (1) Trump's 20+ point Montana win created insurmountable coattails, (2) rural voters who personally liked Sullivan defected on party grounds, and (3) Native American turnout underperformed despite strong support. Personal brand has limits in a nationalized environment.

---

## The Loss: What Happened

### 1. Rural Collapse

The Lewistown focus group was devastating. Among ranchers who knew Sullivan personally, some for decades, the vote was 5-2 for Hansen.

**P1 (knew Sullivan 30 years, Sullivan helped him personally):** "Jack is a good man. But his party isn't."

**P4 (voted Sullivan three times before):** "It breaks my heart... for the first time ever, straight Republican."

**The mechanism:** Party brand became more important than personal relationship. Rural Montanans weren't voting FOR Hansen; they were voting AGAINST Democrats.

### 2. The Nationalization Death Spiral

Every focus group participant - even supporters - understood the dynamic:

**Billings P7:** "Trump's going to carry Montana by 20 points. Maybe it's time to have both senators on the same team."

**Lewistown P3:** "It's not about Jack. It's about sending a message."

Sullivan's 18 years of independent voting, his personal relationships, his rancher authenticity - all of it was overwhelmed by the (D) after his name. Participants explicitly said the party mattered more than the person.

### 3. Native American Turnout Underperformance

The Crow reservation focus group showed unanimous Sullivan support (9-0) but turnout likelihood of only 8.3/10, with two participants at 5-6.

**P2:** "If I vote, probably Sullivan. Likelihood... 5."

**P5:** "I'd vote if I thought it mattered."

We needed near-100% turnout among Native American voters to compensate for rural losses. We got closer to 60%. The math didn't work.

### 4. Billings Couldn't Compensate

Even in Montana's largest city, Sullivan only won the focus group 5-3 (with 2 undecided). Average enthusiasm among supporters was 5.8/10.

**P7 (defector):** "I can't believe I'm saying it. But probably Hansen."

When you're losing Billings 5-4 effectively, you've lost Montana.

## What We Did Right (And Why It Wasn't Enough)

### 1. Constituent Service Was Legendary

Every focus group mentioned it. Sullivan's office saved ranches, fixed VA problems, helped small businesses. P1 in Lewistown specifically cited Sullivan's personal help on BLM issues.

**Why it wasn't enough:** "He helped me personally" wasn't stronger than "His party is destroying the country." Personal gratitude lost to partisan anger.

### 2. 18 Years of Showing Up

Sullivan visited the Crow reservation regularly. He ate at diners in Lewistown. He wasn't a stranger.

**Why it wasn't enough:** Presence mattered but didn't create immunity. P1 (Lewistown): "Jack is a good man. But his party isn't."

### 3. Independent Voting Record

Sullivan voted against his party on guns, energy, and taxes. The focus groups knew this.

**Why it wasn't enough:** "At some point, you are what you vote with." - P6, Lewistown. Occasional breaks weren't enough. He caucused Democrat, gave Democrats the majority, and that's what counted.

---

## What We Did Wrong

### 1. Over-Relied on Personal Brand

The core assumption - Sullivan's personal reputation could overcome party headwinds - was wrong. By 2024, partisanship overwhelmed personality.

### 2. Native American Turnout Operation Underbuilt

We needed 90%+ turnout on reservations. We got 60%. The infrastructure wasn't sufficient.

**P5 (Crow):** "I'd vote if I thought it mattered. Convince me it matters."

We didn't convince her.

### 3. No Effective Party Distance Message

Sullivan tried to run as "not a typical Democrat" but there's no clean break possible. Voters understood he still caucused with Democrats, still gave them the majority.

### 4. Fear Message Without Hope

The closing argument was defensive: "Hansen would be worse." From the Crow focus group:

**P8:** "We're always defending, never advancing."

When your message is "less bad," enthusiasm suffers.

## Lessons for Future Montana Campaigns

### 1. Montana Is Now a Red State

Accept reality. Trump won Montana by 20+ points. A Democrat winning statewide needs to run 15+ points ahead of the national party. That may no longer be possible for anyone.

### 2. Personal Brand Has Limits

Sullivan was perhaps the best-positioned Democrat in America to win a red state. Rancher. Conservative votes. 18 years of relationships. He lost anyway. No future candidate will have better positioning.

### 3. Native American Turnout Is Make-or-Break

Any future Democrat MUST invest heavily in reservation turnout:
- Transportation to polls
- ID assistance
- Year-round engagement, not just election season
- Youth-to-youth organizing

Without near-maximum Native American turnout, the math is impossible.

### 4. Can't Outrun the Party Brand

Every Democratic vulnerability - guns, immigration, climate, cultural issues - attached to Sullivan despite his record. The only answer is changing the party's image, which a single candidate cannot do.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Vote Intent | Actual Result | Gap |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Billings urban | 5-3 Sullivan | Lost by 2 | Enthusiasm gap |
| Rural ranching | 2-5 Hansen | Lost by 25+ | Complete collapse |
| Native reservations | 9-0 Sullivan | Won by 40 | Turnout underperformed |

## The P1 Story (Lewistown)

This is the race in one person:

- 62-year-old cattle rancher
- Fifth-generation Montana
- Known Sullivan 30 years
- Sullivan personally helped him on BLM issues, water rights
- Voting for Hansen

**Quote:** "Probably Hansen. God help me, probably Hansen."

When you lose someone like P1, you've lost Montana.

## Comparison: What Sullivan Had vs. What He Needed

| Asset | Sullivan Had | Required to Win |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Personal favorability | High | Not enough alone |
| Constituent service | Legendary | Didn't override party |
| Rural relationships | Extensive | Collapsed anyway |
| Native support | 90%+ | Turnout fell short |
| Crossover potential | Some | Not in Trump year |
| Time in office | 18 years | Became liability |

## Recommendations for Future Red-State Democrats

### 1. If Running, Accept Long Odds

Montana statewide for a Democrat is now like winning a D+15 state as a Republican. Possible, but requires opponent collapse and perfect execution.

### 2. Invest Massively in Tribal Turnout

Non-negotiable. Transportation, ID help, year-round presence, youth engagement. This is the math.

### 3. Find New Crossover Issues

Public lands, outdoor recreation, anti-corporate messaging. What issues can break through partisan filter?

### 4. Consider Lower Office

Governor, Attorney General may be more achievable than Senate. Different dynamics, more local focus.

### 5. Rebuild Party Image Long-Term

One candidate cannot fix the Democratic brand in Montana. Requires sustained investment in rural presence, cultural moderation, economic populism.

## Conclusion

Jack Sullivan did almost everything right and still lost. That's the hardest kind of loss to analyze because there's no clear mistake to avoid next time.

The lesson is structural: Montana has moved out of reach for Democrats in federal races during presidential years. Personal brand, relationships, and independent voting can no longer overcome party polarization.

Future candidates must decide whether the race is worth running at all - and if so, must plan for a fundamentally different approach than Sullivan's.
