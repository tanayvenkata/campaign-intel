  "notes": "CRITICAL LOSS. Three-term incumbent with legendary constituent service and bipartisan reputation couldn't survive Trump coattails and state's rightward shift. Focus groups showed cultural disconnect between Sullivan and national Democratic Party was too wide to bridge. Rural voters who personally liked Sullivan voted against him on party label. Native American turnout underperformed. Billings couldn't compensate. Lessons: Personal brand has limits in nationalized environment."
