# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** North Carolina Governor 2024
**Candidate:** Will Patterson (D)
**Opponent:** Russell Chambers (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+8.5%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Will Patterson won the North Carolina governor's race by 8.5 points - a landslide in a state Trump carried. This race was decided by one thing: Russell Chambers' catastrophic candidacy. His offensive online comments, extreme positions, and toxic character made him unacceptable to voters who otherwise would have voted Republican. Focus groups showed unanimous opposition to Chambers across all regions, including from lifelong Republicans who couldn't reconcile his behavior with their values.

## The Chambers Collapse

### Online Comments Were Definitive

The revelation of Chambers' offensive online comments - about women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people - was the race-ending moment. Every focus group reacted with revulsion:

**Charlotte P8 (lifelong Republican):** "I've voted Republican my whole life. I can't vote for him. Period."

**Rural P7 (military conservative):** "I can't look my granddaughters in the eye if I vote for someone who says those things."

**Triangle P5 (LGBTQ+):** "He's called people like me 'filth.' He's an existential threat."

### Character Over Party

The race demonstrated that candidate character can override partisan loyalty when the breach is severe enough:

**Charlotte P7:** "I'm not becoming a Democrat. This is about one candidate being unacceptable."

**Rural P8:** "He claims to be Christian but his words are hateful. That's not Christ."

**Rural P1 (farmer, lifelong Republican):** "Never thought I'd say it."

## What Worked

### 1. Patterson as Safe Alternative

Patterson's credentials - Attorney General, prosecutor, military veteran - provided reassurance to crossover voters:

**Charlotte P4:** "Military veteran. That matters to me."

**Rural P3:** "Veteran matters to me. He served."

Patterson didn't need to be exciting. He needed to be acceptable. He was.

### 2. Geographic Coalition

All three regions - Charlotte suburbs, Research Triangle, and even rural Eastern NC - went decisively for Patterson.

**Charlotte suburbs:** 10-0 Patterson (average enthusiasm 6.4)
**Research Triangle:** 10-0 Patterson (average enthusiasm 7.9)
**Rural Eastern NC:** 7-0 Patterson among deciders

### 3. Education as Winning Issue

Chambers' extreme education positions - vouchers, book bans, arming teachers - mobilized educators and parents:

**Triangle P8:** "He wants to defund public schools, arm teachers, ban books. It's a nightmare."

### 4. Business Community Concerns

Charlotte's banking and business community rejected Chambers for economic reasons:

**Charlotte P1:** "Imagine him at a business recruitment event. Companies would run the other direction."

**Triangle P9:** "The business community in the Triangle is quietly panicking about him."

---

## What Didn't Work (For Chambers)

### 1. Republican Base Couldn't Save Him

Even in rural Eastern NC, Republicans crossed over or skipped the race:

**Rural P5:** "Might skip this race. Can't vote for either."

When your base won't vote for you, there's no path.

### 2. Extreme Positions Compounded Character Problems

Chambers' policy extremism - abortion with no exceptions, attacking LGBTQ+ people, defunding public schools - reinforced the character narrative rather than providing a separate appeal.

### 3. No Effective Counter-Narrative

There was no response to the character attacks that voters found credible. The comments were real. The apologies were insufficient. The damage was permanent.

## Lessons for Future Races

### 1. Candidate Quality Can Be Determinative

This race was decided before the general election began. Chambers' nomination was the defeat. Lesson: Screen candidates for character, not just ideology.

### 2. Character Can Override Partisanship (Sometimes)

In an era of polarization, we saw voters cross party lines at remarkable rates because of character. This is not common but it's possible when the contrast is stark enough.

### 3. "Safe Harbor" Candidates Win Crossover Elections

Patterson didn't need to be inspiring. He needed to be acceptable to Republicans looking for permission to vote against Chambers. Credentials (prosecutor, veteran) provided that permission.

### 4. LGBTQ+ Community as Mobilized Base

Chambers' anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric created an existential motivation. P5 (Triangle) at 10 enthusiasm: "This is personal."

### 5. Business Case Against Extremism

Framing extremism as an economic development threat resonated in Charlotte. Corporate recruiters, business leaders, banking community all rejected Chambers for practical reasons.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Vote | Enthusiasm | Key Drivers |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|
| Charlotte suburbs | 10-0 Patterson | 6.4 | Character, business |
| Research Triangle | 10-0 Patterson | 7.9 | Education, LGBTQ+, science |

## Crossover Analysis

The depth of Republican crossover was unprecedented:

### Charlotte
- P2 (Trump 2020): "Holding my nose but Chambers is impossible."
- P7 (Republican lean): "Just this once."
- P8 (moderate Republican): "Chambers is disqualifying."

### Rural Eastern NC
- P1 (farmer, lifelong Republican): "First non-Republican vote since Reagan."
- P7 (military conservative): "For my granddaughters."
- P8 (evangelical): "This time."

### Common Profile
These are character-focused voters who prioritize dignity, family, and basic decency over party loyalty. They needed permission to vote Democrat, and Chambers provided that permission through his own behavior.

## Recommendations for Future Races

### For Democrats:

1. **Credential your candidates** - Prosecutor, military, business experience provides "safe harbor" for crossover voters.

2. **Don't rely on opponent collapse** - Patterson would have had a race without Chambers' scandal. Build your own coalition.

3. **Education as coalition issue** - Public school support unifies base and attracts suburban parents.

4. **Business case for moderation** - Charlotte's economic development concerns about extremism were real.

### For Republicans:

1. **Screen candidates for character** - Chambers' problems were knowable before the nomination. The warning signs were ignored.

2. **Social media is forever** - Online comments from years ago will surface. They will define you.

3. **Christian values must be demonstrated, not claimed** - Evangelical voters rejected Chambers because his behavior contradicted his claimed values.

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +8.5% (approximately 350,000 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Charlotte/Mecklenburg area: +120,000
- Research Triangle: +150,000
- Republican crossover statewide: +100,000
- Rural areas (reduced losses): +30,000 net improvement

**This coalition was built on opponent weakness. Sustaining it requires more than "not Chambers."**
