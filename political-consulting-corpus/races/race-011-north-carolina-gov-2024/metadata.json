  "notes": "Decisive win (+8.5%) driven by opponent scandal. Chambers' offensive online comments and extreme positions made him unacceptable to suburban voters who otherwise lean Republican. Patterson's prosecutor/veteran background provided credibility on crime and security. Charlotte suburbs and Research Triangle delivered massive margins. Even some rural voters crossed over due to Chambers' character. Race demonstrates importance of candidate quality and how scandal can collapse a candidacy."
