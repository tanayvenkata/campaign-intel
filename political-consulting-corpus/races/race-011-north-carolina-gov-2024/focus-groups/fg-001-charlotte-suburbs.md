## Discussion

### Opening: Charlotte in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's Charlotte like right now?

**P1:** Growing fast. Banking headquarters, transplants from everywhere. It's not the Charlotte of 20 years ago.

**P6:** I moved from San Francisco. Charlotte is more affordable, more diverse than I expected.

**P3:** Great for families. Good schools in the suburbs. But traffic is getting worse.

**P7:** Small business is challenging. Competition, labor costs. But Charlotte's economy is strong.

**P8:** Financial services drives this city. If the banks do well, Charlotte does well.

**P4:** The military presence in the region matters. Fort Liberty (Bragg), Camp Lejeune. Lots of veterans here.

**P10:** School funding is always a battle. Too much depends on local taxes.

**P5:** Healthcare is growing too. Atrium, Novant - big employers.

**P2:** I commute from SC but work in Charlotte. The growth is real but so are the growing pains.

**P9:** Young professionals are moving here. It's not NYC prices but it's getting there.

### Russell Chambers: The Scandal (15:00 - 40:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Russell Chambers, the Republican candidate for Governor. What have you heard?

**P3:** The online comments. Have you seen them? They're disgusting.

**P1:** I couldn't believe it when it came out. Talking about women, about minorities... it's vile.

**P8:** I've voted Republican my whole life. I can't vote for him. Period.

**P4:** I'm a military conservative. Character matters. He has none.

**P5:** The things he said about women... as a woman, as a mother, I'm horrified.

**P7:** I'm Republican but there are limits. He crossed every one.

**P2:** The comments are bad but are they real? [Others immediately push back]

**P3:** They're real. He admitted some of them. It's not a hoax.

**P6:** He's said extreme things publicly too. The online stuff is just worse private version.

**P9:** He's compared abortion to Holocaust. He's said horrible things about gay people.

**P10:** He wants to arm teachers. He wants to defund public schools. He's extreme.

**MODERATOR:** P8, you said you've voted Republican your whole life. Tell me more.

**P8:** I care about taxes, business environment, responsible spending. Normal Republican stuff. But this guy is a disgrace. His character is disqualifying.

**P7:** [Nodding] Same. I voted for Trump in 2020. But Chambers? No. Absolutely not.

**P4:** In the military, we judged leaders by their character. He'd never make it.

### Will Patterson: The Alternative (40:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Will Patterson, the Democrat?

**P8:** He's the Attorney General. Prosecutor. Seems competent.

**P4:** Military veteran. That matters to me.

**P1:** He's moderate. Not a radical. That's what I need.

**P5:** His education plan is solid. Supports public schools.

**P3:** He seems like an adult. Normal politician. After what we've seen, that's enough.

**P6:** I'd want him to be more progressive but he's fine.

**P10:** He's been good on education as AG. Supporting teachers.

**P9:** He doesn't have the baggage. That's the biggest thing.

**P7:** [Carefully] He's a Democrat but he's not a crazy Democrat.

**P2:** I don't love him but I can't vote for Chambers.

**MODERATOR:** Is this a vote FOR Patterson or AGAINST Chambers?

**P8:** Against Chambers primarily. But Patterson is acceptable.

**P7:** Same. I'm not becoming a Democrat. This is about one candidate being unacceptable.

**P4:** Patterson earned my respect with military service. It's not just anti-Chambers.

**P1:** A bit of both. Patterson is genuinely qualified.

### Character as Campaign Issue (55:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** How much does character matter in this race?

**P4:** Everything. A governor represents the state. Chambers would embarrass North Carolina.

**P1:** Imagine him at a business recruitment event. Companies would run the other direction.

**P8:** Charlotte is a banking center. We need stability, credibility. Chambers is chaos.

**P3:** As a mom, I can't explain to my kids why we elected someone who says those things.

**P5:** The hypocrisy too - he claims Christian values while saying the most hateful things.

**P7:** Character always mattered to Republicans. What happened?

**P10:** He calls teachers groomers. He wants to arm them. He's dangerous.

**P6:** He's an authoritarian in waiting. The rhetoric is scary.

**P9:** I didn't think character could single-handedly decide a race. It can.

**P2:** [Reluctantly] He makes it easy to vote Democrat this one time.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Patterson. First time voting Democrat for Governor but easy choice.

**P2:** Patterson. Holding my nose but Chambers is impossible.

**P3:** Patterson. Obvious.

**P4:** Patterson. Character and competence.

**P5:** Patterson. For education and sanity.

**P6:** Patterson. Wish he was more progressive but fine.

**P7:** Patterson. Just this once.
