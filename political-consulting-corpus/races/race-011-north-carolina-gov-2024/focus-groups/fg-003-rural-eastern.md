## Discussion

### Opening: Eastern NC Reality (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in Eastern North Carolina?

**P1:** Agriculture is still the backbone. Tobacco is declining but hogs, cotton, soybeans. We're farming people.

**P4:** Kinston has struggled. Factory closures, brain drain. Young people leave.

**P9:** Cost of living is lower than Charlotte or Raleigh but wages are too. Balances out.

**P2:** Vidant (now ECU Health) is the biggest employer in the region. Healthcare is the economy now.

**P3:** After the Marines, I wanted somewhere affordable. Eastern NC works for veterans.

**P6:** ECU is important. Brings young people, some energy. But it's not the Triangle.

**P7:** Military retirees settle here. Affordable, patriotic communities.

**P5:** Running a business in a rural area is challenging. Fewer customers, same fixed costs.

**P8:** Our church is the center of community life. That's how it's always been.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most?

**P1:** Economy. Farm prices. Not being forgotten by Raleigh.

**P2:** Healthcare access. Rural hospitals closing. It's a crisis.

**P8:** Values. What kind of society we're building. Faith matters.

**P3:** Veterans' issues. And basic governance that works.

### Russell Chambers: Discomfort (15:00 - 40:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Russell Chambers.

**P8:** [Carefully] I... have concerns. The things he's said online... they're troubling.

**P1:** He's a Republican. I'm a Republican. But the comments are hard to defend.

**P7:** I'm conservative. Pro-life, pro-gun, the whole thing. But character matters. Those comments...

**P5:** He says things I agree with sometimes. Then he says things that are just... too much.

**P2:** He's extreme on healthcare. Doesn't seem to understand rural hospital closures.

**P4:** He's everything wrong with politics. Hateful, divisive, unfit.

**P6:** He'd be a disaster for ECU and public education generally.

**P3:** I've served with all kinds of people. The things he's said about minorities, about women... unacceptable.

**P9:** I don't follow politics much. But the stuff I've heard about him is bad.

**MODERATOR:** P1, P7, P8 - you're traditional conservative voters. What's your struggle?

**P1:** I've voted Republican since Reagan. This is the first time I'm seriously considering not voting for the Republican. It's painful.

**P7:** Same. I'm military, conservative, Christian. But those comments... I can't look my granddaughters in the eye if I vote for someone who says those things.

**P8:** [Quietly] In church, we talk about Christian values. He claims to be Christian but his words are hateful. That's not Christ.

### Will Patterson: Acceptable Alternative (40:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Will Patterson?

**P4:** He's qualified. AG, prosecutor, veteran. That's real credentials.

**P3:** Veteran matters to me. He served.

**P2:** His healthcare positions are better. Understanding of rural needs.

**P6:** He'd be good for education. Public schools, ECU.

**P7:** He's a Democrat but he's not a radical. He's moderate.

**P1:** [Slowly] He's not who I'd choose if I had options. But Chambers...

**P5:** He'd probably raise taxes. But Chambers is just too much.

**P8:** He seems like a decent person. That matters.

**P9:** Don't know much about him. Better than the other guy seems like.

**MODERATOR:** Is this voting FOR Patterson or AGAINST Chambers?

**P1:** Against Chambers. Mostly.

**P7:** Both. Patterson has earned some respect. Chambers has earned disgust.

**P8:** I'm not becoming a Democrat. But this one time...

### Values and Character (55:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** Some of you mentioned values and character. How do you see that playing out?

**P8:** Real Christian values are love, compassion, humility. Chambers shows none of that.

**P7:** In the military, we evaluated leaders on character. He'd fail that evaluation.

**P1:** My pastor hasn't said anything directly but... the congregation is conflicted.

**P3:** Character is the first thing. If you can't trust someone's character, you can't trust their decisions.

**P4:** Democrats used to be the character-problem party. Now look at who Republicans nominate.

**P5:** [Frustrated] Why couldn't we get a normal Republican? Someone who doesn't embarrass us?

**P2:** It's not about party anymore. It's about basic human decency.

**P6:** Chambers has made it easy to vote against him. That's his accomplishment.

**P9:** I just want someone who's not going to make things worse.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** [Long pause] Probably Patterson. Never thought I'd say it.

**P2:** Patterson. Healthcare.

**P3:** Patterson. Character and service.

**P4:** Patterson. Obviously.

**P5:** Undecided. Might skip this race. Can't vote for either.

**P6:** Patterson. Education.

**P7:** Patterson. For my granddaughters.

**P8:** [Quietly] Patterson. This time.

**P9:** Patterson I guess. Better than the alternative.

**MODERATOR:** Summary?

- **Patterson:** 7 (including P1, P7, P8 - Republican crossovers)
- **Skip race:** 1 (P5)
- **Patterson by default:** 1 (P9)

**In rural Eastern NC, Patterson leads 7-0 among deciders. Remarkable crossover.**

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Rural Republicans crossing over** - P1 (farmer, lifelong Republican), P7 (military), P8 (evangelical) all voting Patterson.

2. **Character-based rejection** - "Those comments... I can't look my granddaughters in the eye."

3. **Christian values conflict** - P8: "He claims to be Christian but his words are hateful."

4. **Permission structure needed** - These voters need reassurance that it's okay to vote Democrat once.

5. **Not becoming Democrats** - "I'm not becoming a Democrat. But this one time..."

### Vote Intent

- **Patterson:** 7
- **Skip race:** 1
- **Patterson by default:** 1

### Republican Crossover Profiles

- **P1 (farmer, lifelong R):** "Never thought I'd say it." First non-Republican vote since Reagan.
- **P7 (military conservative):** "For my granddaughters."
- **P8 (evangelical):** "This time." Quiet, conflicted, but voting Patterson.
