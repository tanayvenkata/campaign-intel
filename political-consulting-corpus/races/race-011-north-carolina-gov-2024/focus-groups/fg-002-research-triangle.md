## Discussion

### Opening: The Triangle in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What defines the Triangle right now?

**P1:** Innovation. Biotech, tech, universities. We're building the economy of the future.

**P2:** Growth. Cary has doubled since I moved here. Amazing and overwhelming.

**P3:** Education. Duke, UNC, NC State - the universities drive everything.

**P5:** Diversity. Durham especially is different from the North Carolina of stereotypes.

**P4:** Transplants changing the politics. We brought our values from the Northeast.

**P6:** Healthcare industry is huge. Duke Health, UNC Health, WakeMed. Major employers.

**P8:** Public schools are at a crossroads. Funding battles, culture wars, teacher retention.

**P7:** Business-friendly state. That's why companies locate here. But politics is getting weird.

**P9:** I moved from Manhattan. The value proposition is incredible. But the state politics worry me.

**P10:** As a grad student, I care about the research environment. State government affects that.

### Russell Chambers: Existential Threat (15:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** What do you think of Russell Chambers?

**P5:** [Immediately] He's called people like me "filth." Literally. He's an existential threat.

**P3:** He would devastate public education. UNC system, public schools - all targets.

**P8:** He wants to defund public schools, arm teachers, ban books. It's a nightmare.

**P1:** As a researcher, his anti-science positions are alarming. Climate denial, vaccine skepticism.

**P2:** The online comments are disqualifying. He's a hateful person.

**P4:** He represents the worst of our politics. Extremism, bigotry, cruelty.

**P6:** His healthcare positions are vague but his rhetoric is scary.

**P7:** I lean conservative on taxes but he's too extreme. I can't.

**P9:** He'd embarrass the state nationally. Companies would reconsider locating here.

**P10:** If he wins, I'm not staying in North Carolina for my career.

**MODERATOR:** P7, you lean conservative. Tell me more.

**P7:** I'm a business guy. I want low taxes, reasonable regulation. But Chambers isn't reasonable about anything. He's a liability for economic development.

**P9:** The business community in the Triangle is quietly panicking about him.

### Will Patterson: Safe Harbor (38:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Will Patterson?

**P4:** He's qualified. Attorney General, prosecutor, veteran. That's a resume.

**P2:** He's moderate enough to win but progressive enough to govern well.

**P3:** I'd prefer someone more progressive but he's solid.

**P5:** He's said the right things about LGBTQ+ rights. That matters.

**P8:** His education plan is detailed. Teachers, funding, public schools. He gets it.

**P6:** Healthcare positions are good. Medicaid expansion, hospital access.

**P1:** He understands the research economy. He's talked about biotech, innovation.

**P7:** He's a Democrat but he's not crazy. I can work with that.

**P9:** He'd be competent. After four years of chaos nationally, competence is valuable.

**P10:** He represents the North Carolina I want to live in.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P3:** He could be bolder on some issues. But electability matters.

**P7:** I don't love everything but the alternative is unacceptable.

**P5:** I wish he was more explicitly progressive but I trust him on the basics.

### Education as Battleground (52:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Education keeps coming up. Let's dig in.

**P8:** Public schools are under attack. Vouchers drain resources. Book bans create chaos.

**P3:** The UNC system - what they've done to DEI, to faculty governance. It's destructive.

**P10:** Academic freedom is at stake. Graduate students are worried.

**P4:** I paid taxes in this state for 30 years. I want public education funded.

**P2:** Chambers wants private school vouchers. That's the end of public education.

**P6:** My kids are in public schools. I chose that. I believe in it.

**P7:** I actually have some sympathy for school choice. But Chambers is too extreme.

**P8:** Patterson gets it. He's talked about teacher pay, class sizes, mental health support.

**P1:** The connection between education and the economy is direct. RTP exists because of the universities.

**P5:** Chambers would turn back the clock on inclusive education. Dangerous for LGBTQ+ students.
