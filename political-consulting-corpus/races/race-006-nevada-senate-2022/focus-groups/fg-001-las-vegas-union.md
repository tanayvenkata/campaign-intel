## Discussion

### Opening: Hospitality Work in 2022 (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Let's talk about what it's like working in hospitality in Las Vegas right now.

**P1:** COVID almost destroyed us. I was out of work for 14 months. Fourteen months. No income. If not for the union fighting for us, I'd have lost everything.

**P8:** The industry came back but different. Staffing is short. We're doing more work with fewer people. Tips are good but we're exhausted.

**P5:** I've been doing this 30 years. The job keeps getting harder. They want us to clean more rooms in less time. My body is breaking down.

**P3:** I'm a single mom. I need this job for the health insurance. If I lose it, my daughter has no coverage. That's terrifying.

**P2:** Bartending is good money but the hours are brutal. Three AM, four AM. I barely see my kids awake.

**P4:** I came here from El Salvador. This job gave me a life - house, car, my kids in college. But it took 20 years of hard work.

**P6:** I have a degree in communications. I'm working front desk because the pay is actually better than entry-level office jobs. That says something about the economy.

**MODERATOR:** How did COVID change things?

**P1:** Fear. We learned the company doesn't care about us. When revenue stopped, they tossed us out. The union saved us.

**P7:** The casinos got bailouts. We got laid off. Then they brought us back at skeleton crews.

**P9:** I got COVID on the job. Twice. The masks came off too fast. They wanted us back before it was safe.

**P10:** I started after COVID. Everyone talks about "before" and "after." I only know after.

**P8:** Some things got better - wages went up because they couldn't find workers. But now inflation ate all of that.

### Economic Reality: Wages vs. Costs (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about money. How are you doing financially?

**P3:** I make $25 an hour with tips. Sounds good, right? My rent is $1,800 for a two-bedroom in Henderson. Do the math.

**P5:** When I started, you could buy a house on a housekeeper's salary. Now? My kids can't even rent near their jobs.

**P2:** I'm making the most money I ever have and I'm still living paycheck to paycheck. Gas, groceries, utilities - everything went up.

**P1:** My husband drives Uber to supplement. Between us, we should be comfortable. We're not.

**P9:** I share an apartment with two roommates. I'm 36. That's not where I thought I'd be.

**P4:** I own my house. Bought in 2005. If I was buying now? Impossible. My kids will never afford what I have.

**P6:** The housing market is insane. People from California brought their money and priced out locals.

**P7:** North Las Vegas used to be affordable. Not anymore. Where do regular people live?

**P8:** The union contract negotiations are crucial. We need raises that beat inflation. Otherwise we're going backwards.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you blame for the economic situation?

**P2:** Everyone. Both parties. But Republicans definitely want to crush unions, so that's worse.

**P1:** Corporations. They made record profits during inflation. We got nothing.

**P7:** Landlords. They raised rents 40% because they could.

**P5:** I don't blame one person. It's the whole system that's broken.

### Senator Sandoval: Union Champion? (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Maria Sandoval is up for re-election. What do you know about her?

**P1:** She's union. Her mother was a housekeeper. She gets it.

**P8:** She's been good on labor issues. PRO Act, minimum wage, worker safety.

**P4:** She's Latina. She understands our community. She speaks Spanish - real Spanish.

**P5:** She came to our contract fight two years ago. Stood with us on the line. Politicians don't usually do that.

**P3:** Her healthcare work matters to me. Fighting to lower drug prices.

**P6:** I know she's our senator but what has she actually gotten done? Washington seems stuck.

**P10:** I don't know much about her honestly. But the union endorses her so that means something.

**P7:** She's better than the alternative. That's usually the choice.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns about her?

**P2:** Inflation happened on her watch. I know it's not all her fault but still.

**P9:** Sometimes feels like she's focused on national stuff. What about Las Vegas specifically?

**P1:** She could be louder. More of a fighter. Sometimes too quiet.

**P6:** The economy is bad. Democrats are in charge. That's just how people think.

### Adam Prescott: The Businessman (52:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Adam Prescott, the Republican candidate?

**P1:** Hotel developer. You know what that means for workers? Nothing good.

**P8:** He's union-busting class. His hotels are non-union. That tells you everything.

**P5:** He says he creates jobs. What kind of jobs? $12 an hour, no benefits, no security?

**P4:** Rich guy who thinks running a business qualifies you for Senate. It doesn't.

**P2:** I've worked in non-union hotels. The difference is night and day. Prescott would love to make all hotels like that.

**P3:** He's against everything I need. Against healthcare expansion. Against worker protections.

**P7:** He doesn't know what it's like to work a double shift then worry about rent. Never has.

**P6:** His economic message is basically "trust me, I'm a businessman." That's not a policy.

**P9:** Some of my family think Republicans are better for business. I keep telling them - not YOUR business.

**P10:** He's running ads constantly. Must be nice to have that money.

**MODERATOR:** Any appeal at all?

**P2:** [Reluctantly] He talks about cutting taxes. Everyone likes lower taxes.

**P6:** He has business experience. That's something.

**P8:** Nothing he says makes me trust him with working people's interests.

### Union as Political Machine (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Culinary Union is famous for political organizing. How does that work?

**P1:** We go door to door. Every election. Members talking to members, talking to neighbors.

**P8:** It's not just endorsing. We turn people out. Buses to polls, early voting drives, registration.

**P5:** The union tells us who to vote for. But honestly? They're usually right.

**P3:** I trust the union's endorsement more than any commercial.

**P4:** In our community, the union is like family. We help each other. Politically too.

**MODERATOR:** Is everyone on board with the union's choice?

**P2:** Mostly. Some guys are more conservative. They vote different but quietly.

**P6:** I make my own decisions but I take the endorsement seriously. They've done the research.

**P7:** Black voters in this union have our own perspective but we're aligned on most things.

**P9:** Young workers follow the union less automatically. We want to know why, not just who.

**P10:** I'm new. I trust the longtime members who know this stuff.

**MODERATOR:** Will the union deliver this election?

**P1:** We always do. This is what we do.

**P8:** The machine is running. Doors being knocked. Phone calls made.

**P5:** My whole building knows who to vote for. I made sure.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Sandoval. She's union. He's not. Simple.

**P2:** Sandoval. Not thrilled about everything but Prescott would be disaster.

**P3:** Sandoval. Healthcare and union rights. I need her.

**P4:** Sandoval. She understands immigrants, workers. He doesn't.

**P5:** Sandoval. My last vote before retirement. Making it count.

**P6:** Probably Sandoval. Wish I was more excited.

**P7:** Sandoval. Black workers need her.

**P8:** Sandoval. 18 years in this union taught me - never vote against labor.

**P9:** Sandoval. For my family's future.

**P10:** Sandoval. Following the union on this.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 9.

**P2:** 6.

**P3:** 8.

**P4:** 8.

**P5:** 9.

**P6:** 5.

**P7:** 7.

**P8:** 8.

**P9:** 7.

**P10:** 6.

**Average: 7.3** - solid but not exceptional.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **COVID trauma lingers** - Workers remember being abandoned. Union loyalty deepened.

2. **Economic pain is real** - Inflation erased wage gains. Housing crisis acute. "Paycheck to paycheck" repeated.

3. **Union endorsement carries weight** - But not blindly followed. Members want to understand why.

4. **Sandoval seen as ally** - Her hospitality background resonates. But some want louder fighting.

5. **Prescott seen as threat** - Non-union hotel owner is disqualifying for union members.

6. **Enthusiasm gap is real** - 7.3 average is concerning. P2 and P6 at 5-6 are potential dropoffs.

### Vote Intent

- **Sandoval:** 10
- **Enthusiasm range:** 5-9 (average 7.3)

### Turnout Concerns

- P2 and P6 are lower enthusiasm. Economic frustration could depress turnout.
- Union machine will need to work to maintain engagement.
- "Not thrilled but..." is not inspiring.

### Key Quotes
