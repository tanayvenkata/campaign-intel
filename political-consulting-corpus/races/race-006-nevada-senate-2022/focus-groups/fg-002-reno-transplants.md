## Discussion

### Opening: Reno's Transformation (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Reno has changed a lot recently. What's that like?

**P2:** I've sold real estate here for 25 years. The last five have been insane. Californians coming with cash, bidding wars, prices up 60%.

**P9:** Born and raised here. Some of these changes are good - more restaurants, culture. But locals are being pushed out.

**P1:** I moved from Mountain View. My house there cost $2 million. I sold it, bought here for $600K, kept the equity. I get why locals resent us.

**P3:** Tesla brought jobs but also changed the vibe. The factory culture is different from old Reno.

**P5:** Reno used to be a small city. Quiet. Affordable. Now it's trying to be San Francisco Junior.

**P6:** I went to UNR and wanted to stay. It's actually gotten harder - wages haven't kept up with costs.

**P10:** I moved from Sacramento for quality of life. Lower costs, outdoor access. But "lower costs" is relative now.

**P4:** My business serves both - locals who've been coming for years, transplants with different tastes. It's an adjustment.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter to you this election?

**P8:** Housing. Nurses make good money but I can barely afford to live near my hospital.

**P7:** Climate. Lake Tahoe is dying from pollution. The drought is real. Smoke season gets worse every year.

**P1:** Honestly? Stability. I left California for sanity. I don't want Nevada going crazy in either direction.

**P5:** Taxes. Nevada has no income tax. That's a feature. Don't mess with it.

**P4:** Economy. Inflation is hitting my business hard. Costs up, customers cutting back.

**P2:** Housing policy. We need to build more but also protect what made Reno special.

### Political Identity: Old Reno vs. New (15:00 - 32:00)

**MODERATOR:** Nevada has been a swing state. How would you describe the political landscape?

**P5:** It used to be libertarian. Leave me alone, I'll leave you alone. Now it's more partisan.

**P9:** Vegas dominates everything. Reno votes one way, Vegas decides the election.

**P1:** I brought California politics with me, I won't lie. But I'm not far left. I'm moderate.

**P10:** Young professionals here are more liberal but also pragmatic. We're not ideological.

**P2:** My clients range from conservative ranchers to tech liberals. I navigate both.

**P3:** At Tesla, it's a weird mix. Tech people who are liberal on social stuff, working class who are more conservative.

**P6:** UNR kids are progressive but they don't vote. That's the problem.

**P7:** I'm an environmentalist in a state that depends on water rights and mining. It's complicated.

**P8:** I've voted both parties. Depends on the candidate, the issues.

**MODERATOR:** How do you see this Senate race?

**P1:** It's about competence vs. ideology. I want someone who'll actually do things.

**P5:** I'm Republican but I care about who the candidate is. Not just the letter.

**P4:** Whoever understands small business gets my attention.

**P6:** Abortion matters. Post-Dobbs, that's on the table.

### Senator Sandoval: Evaluation (32:00 - 48:00)

**MODERATOR:** What do you know about Senator Maria Sandoval?

**P6:** She's been in office a few years. Not super high profile but seems competent.

**P8:** I've seen her on healthcare issues. She fights for things that matter to nurses.

**P1:** I honestly don't know much about her specifically. I know she's Democrat, from Vegas.

**P2:** She's been good for Nevada overall. Brought back some federal money, supported local projects.

**P5:** She's liberal but not crazy liberal. That's something.

**P3:** The union stuff appeals to me. I'm not in a union but I like that she supports them.

**P7:** Her environmental record is okay. Not great but not terrible.

**P10:** She seems professional. That matters more to me than ideology right now.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P9:** She's Vegas. Does she know Reno exists? We always get forgotten.

**P4:** The economy has been rough. She's part of the administration's party. Fair or not, that matters.

**P5:** I'm skeptical of anyone too aligned with Washington Democrats. The national party is out of touch.

**P1:** She needs to be more visible here. I couldn't tell you what she's done for Northern Nevada.

**P8:** Inflation. Cost of living. I'm not sure she has answers.

### Adam Prescott: The Businessman (48:00 - 62:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Adam Prescott?

**P5:** He's a businessman. I like the idea of someone who's run things, not just talked.

**P9:** He developed hotels. He knows the Nevada economy.

**P4:** I've heard his ads. Sounds reasonable. Tax cuts, business friendly, less regulation.

**P3:** Non-union hotels though. That's concerning. Tesla is non-union and it shows.

**P1:** I looked him up. He's more MAGA than he lets on. The moderate image is fake.

**P6:** He's against abortion rights. That's disqualifying for me.

**P7:** Climate denier. Can't take him seriously on anything if he denies basic science.

**P8:** He has no healthcare plan except "cut regulations." That's not a plan.

**P10:** His social media is full of conspiracy stuff. Not the moderate he pretends to be.

**P2:** Some of my clients like him. Business types who want lower taxes.

**MODERATOR:** P5, you mentioned liking businesspeople. Still interested?

**P5:** [Pauses] The more I learn, the less sure I am. I'm not into the MAGA stuff.

**P4:** Same. The ads sound good but the details are concerning.

**P9:** If he was actually moderate, maybe. But he's playing a character.

### Swing Vote Dynamics (62:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Several of you seem undecided. What would sway you?

**P5:** Convince me Sandoval will be independent from the national party. Not just a rubber stamp.

**P4:** Show me a real economic plan. Not slogans - specifics for small business.

**P8:** Healthcare solutions. I'm in the system. It's broken. Fix something.

**P9:** Acknowledge Northern Nevada exists. Come to Reno. Understand our issues aren't Vegas issues.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read a message: "Maria Sandoval grew up the daughter of a casino worker. She knows what it means to work for a living. Adam Prescott is a hotel developer who fights unions and ships profits to his investors. Who's on your side?"

**P3:** That's effective. The class argument works.

**P1:** Simple and clear. I buy it.

**P5:** A little populist for my taste but I see the point.

**P4:** Hits Prescott's weakness. Non-union thing is a problem for him here.

**P2:** Works in Vegas better than Reno maybe. But decent.

[Message 2]: "Adam Prescott says he'll cut taxes. But his hotel developments got huge tax breaks while regular Nevadans pay full price. He wants tax cuts for himself, not for you."

**P5:** Now that's interesting. Hypocrisy angle.

**P4:** Developers getting breaks while I pay full freight? That's infuriating.

**P9:** Local resentment against tax-break developments is real here.

**P1:** Strong message. Makes you question his whole image.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Sandoval. Not excited but she's clearly better.

**P2:** Probably Sandoval. Would love a better Republican option.

**P3:** Sandoval. Union stuff matters to me.

**P4:** Leaning Sandoval now. The Prescott reveal on MAGA stuff changed my mind.

**P5:** Undecided but leaning Sandoval. Can't do the extremism.

**P6:** Definitely Sandoval. Abortion sealed it.

**P7:** Sandoval. Climate denial is disqualifying.

**P8:** Sandoval. Healthcare is my issue.

**P9:** Reluctantly Sandoval. Wish she'd pay more attention to Reno.

**P10:** Sandoval. She seems competent and normal.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 6.

**P2:** 5.

**P3:** 7.

**P4:** 6.

**P5:** 4.

**P6:** 8.

**P7:** 7.

**P8:** 7.

**P9:** 5.

**P10:** 6.

**Average: 6.1** - concerningly low.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Transplant dynamic is complex** - New arrivals brought money, drove up costs, changed culture. Both appreciated and resented.

2. **Prescott's moderate image is thin** - When pressed, participants discovered MAGA connections. The "reasonable businessman" frame collapsed.

3. **Northern Nevada resentment** - "Vegas decides everything." Sandoval seen as Vegas candidate.

4. **Enthusiasm gap is real** - 6.1 average is very low. Many voting against Prescott rather than for Sandoval.

5. **Abortion mattered for younger women** - P6 explicitly cited it as decisive.

6. **Climate and environment** - Smoke season, Lake Tahoe, drought - outdoor enthusiasts care about climate.

### Vote Intent

- **Sandoval:** 9
- **Leaning Sandoval:** 1
- **Enthusiasm range:** 4-8 (average 6.1)

### Persuadable Voters

- **P5** (retired teacher, moderate Republican): Leaning Sandoval but at 4 enthusiasm. Could stay home.
- **P2** and **P9** (longtime residents): Low enthusiasm, resentment of Vegas dominance. Need Reno-specific outreach.

### Recommendations

1. **Reno visibility needed** - Senator needs more Northern Nevada presence.
2. **Expose Prescott's extremism** - Moderate image is fragile.
3. **Economic specifics** - Generic messaging isn't enough for this audience.
4. **Housing policy** - Cross-cutting issue for transplants and natives alike.

### Key Quotes

> "I sold my Mountain View house for $2 million, bought here for $600K. I get why locals resent us." - P1

> "The moderate image is fake." - P1 (on Prescott)

> "If he was actually moderate, maybe. But he's playing a character." - P9

> "Convince me Sandoval will be independent from the national party." - P5
