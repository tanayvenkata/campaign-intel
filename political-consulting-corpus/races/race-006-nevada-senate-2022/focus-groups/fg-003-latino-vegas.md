## Discussion

### Opening: Latino Life in Las Vegas (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Gracias por venir. Let's start with what life is like for Latinos in Las Vegas today.

**P3:** I've been here 40 years. Raised my children here. This is home. But it's changed - more expensive, more crowded.

**P1:** We've been here three generations. My grandparents came for casino jobs. Now we're everywhere - professionals, business owners, not just service workers.

**P4:** I own a restaurant. Serving the community for 15 years. Business is harder now - costs up, workers hard to find.

**P7:** I take care of elderly people. The work is hard, the pay is low. But I'm providing for my daughters.

**P2:** Puerto Ricans have a different experience - we're citizens by birth. But we're still seen as "other" sometimes.

**P6:** I'm Cuban. We tend to vote differently. But the economy doesn't care about your politics - it hits everyone.

**MODERATOR:** What issues are on your mind this election?

**P7:** Money. Can I make rent? Can I afford groceries? Gas to get to work?

**P4:** The economy. Inflation is killing small businesses. And I can't raise prices more - customers can't afford it.

**P5:** Healthcare costs. Even with insurance, everything is expensive.

**P9:** Education. Our schools are underfunded. Class sizes are huge. Teachers are leaving.

**P10:** Climate, housing, student debt. The future seems harder than it should be.

**P8:** Housing specifically. I sell houses and half my friends can't afford to buy.

**P3:** Everything costs more. My fixed income doesn't stretch like it used to.

### Senator Sandoval: Nuestra Senadora? (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Sandoval is up for re-election. What do you think of her?

**P3:** She's one of us. Her mother cleaned rooms at the Sands. She understands where we come from.

**P1:** She's been good for the community. Shows up, listens, actually knows our issues.

**P9:** In education circles, she's respected. Fights for school funding.

**P2:** The union loves her. PRO Act, workers' rights - she's solid on labor.

**P7:** She helped with immigration stuff when my neighbor was in trouble. Not personally, but her office did.

**P5:** I've met her at a UNLV event. Seemed genuine, not just working a crowd.

**P10:** For young Latinos, she represents what's possible. First Latina Senator from Nevada.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns?

**P4:** The economy is bad. She's Democrat, they're in power. Fair or not, she gets some blame.

**P6:** I'm more conservative. She's too far left on some things for me.

**P8:** She needs to talk more about economic growth, not just worker protection. Both matter.

**P1:** She could be more visible. Sometimes feels like she disappears until election time.

**P3:** She's good but we need results. Promises only go so far.

**MODERATOR:** P6, you mentioned being more conservative. Tell me more.

**P6:** I'm Cuban. We fled communism. When I hear "socialism" or too much government, I get nervous. I know she's not that, but...

**P4:** I'm business owner. I don't want more regulations, more taxes. But I also don't want workers exploited. It's complicated.

**P8:** I vote on economics. Both parties claim to help but neither really delivers.

### Adam Prescott: Alternative? (35:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Adam Prescott?

**P6:** He's Republican, business background. On paper, I should like him.

**P4:** His economic message appeals to me. But then I hear other stuff...

**P8:** He talks about cutting regulations. But specifically which ones? The vague stuff is suspicious.

**P1:** He's a hotel developer. Those guys aren't friends to workers.

**P2:** Non-union hotels. We know what that means. Exploitation, no protections.

**P3:** He doesn't understand our community. He sees us as cheap labor, not families.

**P7:** I don't trust him. Rich people promising to help regular people - heard that before.

**P9:** His education policy is vouchers. That would destroy public schools.

**P5:** He says he's pro-business but he means big business. Not little guy like my clinic.

**P10:** He's doing the Republican Latino outreach thing. "Republicans are really for you." We're not stupid.

**MODERATOR:** P6, you seemed interested. Still?

**P6:** [Sighs] I wish there was a reasonable Republican. He's not really that. The more I hear, the less I like.

**P4:** Same. I want to support business-friendly candidates but not at the expense of my workers, my community.

### Cultural Politics and Latino Vote (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Both parties are competing for Latino votes. How do you see that?

**P10:** Democrats assume we'll vote for them. That's arrogant. Republicans assume we're socially conservative. That's stereotyping.

**P1:** We're not a monolith. Mexican-American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Salvadoran - different experiences.

**P6:** Cubans lean Republican for historical reasons. But the new Republicans are different - more extreme.

**P2:** Puerto Ricans are American citizens but Trump threw paper towels at us. That doesn't get forgotten.

**P3:** The older generation, we vote for who helps us. Not party loyalty.

**P9:** Education is what motivates me. Whoever supports public schools gets my attention.

**P7:** Immigration isn't my top issue - I'm documented, my family is - but the rhetoric matters. How they talk about us.

**MODERATOR:** Does Sandoval being Latina matter to you?

**P3:** Yes. Representation matters. She knows what we face.

**P10:** It's important but not sufficient. She has to deliver, not just represent.

**P1:** Her mother was a housekeeper. That's not political branding - that's her story.

**P8:** I care more about policy than identity. But cultural understanding helps.

**P6:** I've voted for white candidates who helped my community. Identity isn't everything.

### Message Testing (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some messages.

[Message 1 - Heritage]: "Maria Sandoval's mother was a hotel housekeeper. Her father worked in the casinos. She grew up in our community and never forgot where she came from. Adam Prescott grew up wealthy and has never had to struggle a day in his life."

**P3:** That's our story. She really is one of us. 9.

**P7:** Moving. Authentic. 8.

**P1:** Works for me. She earned it. 8.

**P10:** Good class framing. 7.

**P6:** A little heavy on the class warfare but I see the point. 6.

**P8:** Effective contrast. 7.

**P4:** Relatable to my own story. 8.

[Message 2 - Economic protection]: "Maria Sandoval is fighting to lower costs for Nevada families - capping insulin prices, lowering prescription drugs, fighting corporate price gouging. Adam Prescott wants to cut regulations that protect consumers."

**P5:** Healthcare costs are real. This speaks to me. 9.

**P7:** Yes, this matters daily. 8.

**P3:** Drug prices affect everyone on Medicare. 9.

**P4:** Consumer protection isn't anti-business. It's anti-cheating. 7.

**P6:** I like this better. Practical, not just emotional. 8.

[Message 3 - Workers]: "The choice is clear: Maria Sandoval stands with working families. Adam Prescott built his fortune on the backs of workers in non-union hotels. He'll protect profits, not your paycheck."

**P2:** Union message, strong. 9.

**P1:** Cuts through the noise. 8.

**P6:** A bit strong. But effective. 6.

**P8:** The non-union thing is damaging for him. 7.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Sandoval. She's earned it over years.

**P2:** Sandoval. Union all the way.

**P3:** Sandoval. For my grandchildren's future.

**P4:** Sandoval. Even as a business owner, I can't support Prescott.

**P5:** Sandoval. Healthcare is too important.

**P6:** Probably Sandoval. [Pauses] Yeah, Sandoval. Prescott isn't what I hoped.

**P7:** Definitely Sandoval. She understands people like me.

**P8:** Sandoval. Not enthusiastic but it's the right choice.

**P9:** Sandoval. For public education.

**P10:** Sandoval. And I'm organizing my friends.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 8.

**P2:** 9.

**P3:** 9.

**P4:** 6.

**P5:** 7.

**P6:** 5.

**P7:** 8.

**P8:** 5.

**P9:** 8.

**P10:** 9.

**Average: 7.4** - good but with notable soft spots.

**MODERATOR:** Gracias a todos.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Class identity more than ethnic identity** - Sandoval's working-class background resonates more than just being Latina.

2. **Cuban and business-owner persuadables exist** - P6 (Cuban, conservative) and P4/P8 (business focus) were persuadable. Ended with Sandoval but lower enthusiasm.

3. **Prescott's business image collapses** - "Non-union hotels" is effective attack. Business-friendly doesn't mean worker-friendly.

4. **Economic message must be specific** - "Lower costs" with concrete examples (insulin, prescriptions) worked better than abstract claims.

5. **Not a monolith** - Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Salvadoran - different experiences, different politics, but converging on Sandoval.

6. **Youth engagement is strong** - P10 at 9 enthusiasm and organizing friends. Good sign.

### Vote Intent

- **Sandoval:** 10
- **Enthusiasm range:** 5-9 (average 7.4)

### Persuadable Profiles

- **P6 (Cuban, 55, conservative):** Ultimately came to Sandoval but 5 enthusiasm. Economic voter frustrated with both parties.
- **P8 (Real estate, 32, moderate):** Business-focused, 5 enthusiasm. Needs economic growth messaging, not just protection.
- **P4 (Restaurant owner, 41):** Business owner who came to Sandoval but at 6. Balance worker protection with business concerns.

### Recommendations

1. **Specific economic wins** - Name policies, show concrete benefits.
2. **Working-class solidarity** - Her background is the message. Keep telling it.
3. **Don't assume Latino vote** - Earn it with presence, policy, respect.
4. **Cuban outreach** - Different messaging needed. Emphasize freedom, opportunity, anti-extremism.
