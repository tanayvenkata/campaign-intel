# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Nevada Senate 2022
**Candidate:** Maria Sandoval (D)
**Opponent:** Adam Prescott (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+0.8%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Maria Sandoval won re-election by 0.8 points - roughly 7,500 votes - in the closest Senate race in the country. Victory came from three sources: Culinary Union turnout operation, Latino community mobilization, and Northern Nevada persuadables who rejected Prescott's extremism when pressed. The enthusiasm gap was real and concerning - average enthusiasm across all three focus groups was only 7.1/10. This was a race won by organization and opponent weakness, not inspiration.

## What Worked

### 1. Culinary Union Turnout Machine

The Las Vegas union focus group showed why the Culinary Union is the most effective political operation in the state:

**Key dynamics:**
- 100% Sandoval support among union members
- Institutional trust: "The union endorsement means something"
- Door-to-door, member-to-member organizing infrastructure
- COVID trauma created deep loyalty to union that protected them

**Evidence:**
> "If not for the union fighting for us, I'd have lost everything." - P1

The union turned out hospitality workers in numbers that made up for enthusiasm deficit elsewhere.

### 2. Working-Class Biography

Sandoval's personal story - daughter of a housekeeper and casino worker - resonated across audiences:

**Latino Vegas:**
> "Her mother cleaned rooms at the Sands. She understands where we come from." - P3

**Union workers:**
> "She's union. Her mother was a housekeeper. She gets it." - P1

**Class frame beat identity frame** - Participants responded more strongly to her working-class roots than to her Latina identity alone. The two together were powerful.

### 3. Prescott's Moderate Image Collapse

In Reno particularly, Prescott's "reasonable businessman" image fell apart under scrutiny:

**Key moments:**
- P1 (Reno transplant): "I looked him up. He's more MAGA than he lets on. The moderate image is fake."
- P5 (moderate Republican): "The more I learn, the less sure I am."

**Attack that worked:** "His hotels are non-union" was the most effective single attack, especially with union workers and working-class Latinos.

### 4. Specific Economic Messages

Generic economic messaging failed. Specific benefits worked:

**Weak:** "Fighting for working families"
**Strong:** "Capping insulin prices, lowering prescription drugs"

Focus groups consistently responded better to concrete, nameable policies than abstract promises.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Northern Nevada Enthusiasm Gap

Reno focus group showed concerning softness:

- Average enthusiasm: 6.1/10 (vs. 7.4 in Latino Vegas, 7.3 in Union)
- P5 (moderate Republican leaning Sandoval): "I'm at a 4"
- Perception that Sandoval is "Vegas-focused"

> "She's Vegas. Does she know Reno exists?" - P9

**Problem:** Northern Nevada felt neglected. This could have been decisive in a race this close.

### 2. Economic Defense Was Weak

Across all groups, participants voiced economic frustration that wasn't fully answered:

**Union workers:**
> "Inflation happened on her watch. I know it's not all her fault but still." - P2

**Reno:**
> "The economy is bad. Democrats are in charge. That's just how people think." - P6

**Latino Vegas:**
> "The economy is bad. She's Democrat, they're in power." - P4

**Problem:** No compelling economic narrative to counter "inflation = Democrats" frame.

### 3. Conservative Latino Outreach Incomplete

P6 (Cuban, conservative) ended up supporting Sandoval but at only 5 enthusiasm:

> "I wish there was a reasonable Republican."

**Insight:** Conservative Latinos (particularly Cubans) are persuadable but need different messaging. Economic freedom, anti-extremism, and anti-communism frames work better than worker protection frames.

### 4. Visibility Between Elections

Multiple participants mentioned Sandoval being invisible except during campaigns:

> "Sometimes feels like she disappears until election time." - P1 (Latino Vegas)

> "She could be more visible." - P1 (Latino Vegas)

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Organization Can Beat Enthusiasm

With only 7.1/10 average enthusiasm, we won by 0.8 points. The Culinary Union's turnout operation - door-to-door, member-to-member - overcame the inspiration deficit. Lesson: Build organization that doesn't depend on enthusiasm.

### 2. Opponent's Image Is Fragile

Prescott spent millions building "reasonable businessman" brand. It collapsed when voters actually learned about him. Lesson: Opposition research and message discipline can reshape perceptions of opponents.

### 3. Class Trumps Identity (Usually)

Sandoval's working-class background was more powerful than her Latina identity alone. Lesson: Lead with shared economic experience, layer identity on top.

### 4. Northern Nevada Requires Investment

Cannot rely on Vegas margins alone. Reno transplants are persuadable; longtime residents feel neglected. Lesson: Show up, listen, deliver for Northern Nevada.

### 5. Conservative Latinos Are a Segment

Cuban-Americans and business-owning Latinos have different political orientation. They're persuadable but need different messaging - freedom, opportunity, anti-extremism rather than worker protection.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Vote | Enthusiasm | Key Drivers |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|
| Culinary Union workers | Sandoval | 7.3/10 | Union loyalty, COVID protection memory |
| Latino community (progressive) | Sandoval | 8.0/10 | Representation, working-class biography |
| Latino business owners | Sandoval | 6.0/10 | Reluctant, anti-Prescott more than pro-Sandoval |
| Conservative Latinos (Cuban) | Sandoval | 5.0/10 | Anti-extremism, Prescott disappointed them |
| Reno transplants | Sandoval | 6.1/10 | Anti-MAGA, but low enthusiasm |
| Reno natives | Sandoval | 5.5/10 | Resentment of Vegas dominance |

## Geographic Insights

**Clark County (Las Vegas):**
- Union turnout operation delivered
- Latino community mobilized effectively
- Housing costs creating real stress
- COVID memory remains powerful motivator

**Washoe County (Reno):**
- Transplant vs. native tension
- Feeling neglected relative to Vegas
- More swing voters, less base mobilization
- Housing crisis affecting even professionals

**Rural Nevada:**
- Did not focus group; assumed loss
- Some persuadable anti-extremism voters

## Recommendations for Future Nevada Races

1. **Maintain Culinary Union relationship** - This is the single most important asset. Protect it.

2. **Year-round Northern Nevada presence** - Cannot only show up for elections. Ongoing visibility needed.

3. **Develop economic counter-narrative** - Need response to "inflation = Democrats" that's more compelling than "it's global."

4. **Segment Latino outreach** - Different approaches for progressive community members vs. conservative/business-oriented.

5. **Specific over general** - Name policies, show concrete benefits. "Capped insulin at $35" beats "fighting for you."

6. **Housing policy priority** - This is becoming a cross-partisan concern. Lead on it.

7. **Water messaging for future** - Lake Mead crisis is coming. Get ahead of it.

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +0.8% (approximately 7,500 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Culinary Union over-performance: ~6,000 votes
- Latino community turnout: ~5,000 votes
- Reno anti-Prescott voters: ~3,000 votes
- Rural Nevada losses: ~6,500 net loss

**Coalition was just barely sufficient.** Any single piece missing = loss.
