## Discussion

### Opening: Fox Valley Economic Reality (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thanks everyone for joining us. Let's start with how the economy is affecting you here in the Fox Valley.

**P1:** The paper industry is what built this valley. Good union jobs. My dad worked at the mill, I work at the mill. But it's changing. Automation, competition from overseas. The future feels uncertain.

**P5:** I spent 35 years at Kimberly-Clark. Saw the good times and the changes. The valley has adapted - we've got healthcare, insurance, some tech. But manufacturing is still the heart and it's under pressure.

**P9:** I'm 33, trying to raise a family. My wife and I both work. Daycare is $1,500 a month. Groceries are insane. Gas to get to work. We're not getting ahead, we're treading water.

**P4:** I drive a school bus. Part-time, no benefits. I do it to help make ends meet while my husband works at the foundry. The inflation has been brutal on us.

**P7:** I own an auto repair shop. Business is actually okay - people are keeping cars longer instead of buying new, so they need repairs. But my costs are up. Parts, rent, everything.

**P2:** At my company, we're seeing orders slow down. Manufacturing is cyclical but this feels different. There's anxiety about a recession.

**MODERATOR:** What's the single biggest economic concern for you?

**P9:** Cost of living. The prices of everything.

**P4:** Same. Groceries. Gas. It's relentless.

**P1:** Job security. Whether the mill will still be here in ten years.

**P5:** For me it's retirement security. I'm okay, but I worry about my pension if the economy goes bad.

**P7:** Regulations and taxes. Government making it harder to run a small business.

**P6:** Healthcare costs. I work in healthcare and I can barely afford my own insurance.

**P3:** All of the above. The economy feels fragile. One bad thing and everything falls apart.

---

### Economic Credibility Battle (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** When it comes to the economy, who do you trust more - Karen Kowalski or Steve Lindquist?

**P5:** Lindquist. He ran a manufacturing company right here in Waukesha. He understands what it takes to create jobs.

**P7:** Same. Lindquist is a business guy. He's made a payroll. He knows the real world.

**P2:** I lean toward Lindquist on economics. He has practical experience that politicians usually don't have.

**P8:** Lindquist. Republicans are generally better on the economy. Lower taxes, less regulation.

**P1:** I'm torn. My union leans Democratic. But the economy under Democrats right now is a mess. I'm not sure who to trust.

**P3:** I voted for Biden hoping things would get better. They got worse. Inflation is through the roof. Maybe Republicans have a point.

**P9:** Honestly, neither. Politicians don't understand what it's like to choose between paying rent and buying groceries.

**P4:** I don't know enough about either to say.

**P6:** Kowalski probably cares more about regular people, but I don't know if she knows how to fix the economy.

**P10:** The drug pricing stuff is important to me. Kowalski is better on that. But overall economy... I don't know.

**MODERATOR:** Let me ask specifically about Lindquist's business background. He ran a manufacturing company. Does that give him credibility?

**P5:** Absolutely. He's not some career politician. He's been in the real world.

**P7:** Yes. Running a business teaches you things politics can't teach.

**P1:** It matters. The paper companies here are what keep this valley alive. Someone who's run a company understands that.

**P2:** It's a plus. Not the only thing, but it's credible.

**P3:** He created jobs, right? That's more than most politicians have done.

**P9:** I'm skeptical. CEOs look out for CEOs, not workers.

**P6:** Some business people are good, some are bad. I'd want to know what kind of company he ran.

### Kowalski's Economic Message: The Test (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you Karen Kowalski's main economic message and get your reaction: "Karen Kowalski will fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share."

**P5:** [Dismissive] "Corporate greed." That's a soundbite, not a policy. What's she actually going to do?

**P7:** "Wealthy pay their fair share" means higher taxes. I'm not wealthy but I know that tax increases always hit the middle class eventually.

**P3:** This sounds like every Democrat ever. Obama said it. Hillary said it. Biden said it. Things don't change.

**P1:** I'm sympathetic to the idea - corporations do take advantage sometimes. But how does this lower gas prices? That's what I want to know.

**P2:** It's too vague. What are the specific policies?

**P8:** This is standard Democratic messaging. It doesn't address the current crisis.

**P9:** I don't disagree with her, but it's just words. Politicians always say they'll fight for us. Then what?

**P4:** What does "fight for" even mean? I want action, not fighting.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**P1:** 2.

**P2:** 2.

**P3:** 2.

**P4:** 3.

**P5:** 1.

**P6:** 3.

**P7:** 1.

**P8:** 2.

**P9:** 2.

**P10:** 3.

**Average: 2.1/5** - Message failing badly

**MODERATOR:** Now let me read Lindquist's message: "Steve Lindquist created hundreds of jobs in Wisconsin. He understands what businesses need to grow and hire. Karen Kowalski has spent her career in government. Steve Lindquist has spent his creating jobs."

**P5:** That's a strong contrast. Jobs creator versus career politician.

**P7:** This is exactly right. We need people who've been in the private sector.

**P3:** I like that he created jobs. That's tangible. What has she created?

**P1:** It's a fair point. The economy needs people who understand business.

**P2:** This makes me take Lindquist more seriously.

**P8:** Career politician is a negative. He's smart to use it.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Average: 3.7/5** - Lindquist's message winning

---

### Manufacturing Future Concerns (55:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Fox Valley has a manufacturing heritage. What do you see as the future of manufacturing here?

**P1:** Automation is changing everything. The mill has fewer workers than when my dad was there. Machines do more. That's the trend.

**P5:** Manufacturing will survive but it'll be different. More skilled, fewer unskilled jobs. People need training.

**P3:** The jobs are still here but they don't pay what they used to. Or they require degrees now.

**P9:** Amazon has a warehouse near Oshkosh. Those jobs replaced some manufacturing. But warehouse jobs aren't the same - less pay, worse conditions.

**P2:** Paper is still big here, but healthcare is growing. The economy is diversifying.

**MODERATOR:** What should the government be doing to support manufacturing?

**P7:** Get out of the way. Less regulation. Let businesses operate.

**P5:** Trade policy matters. Make sure American products can compete fairly.

**P1:** Job training. Help workers adapt to new technologies. Community college programs.

**P3:** Don't give all the tax breaks to big companies. Help small and medium manufacturers too.

**P6:** Healthcare costs. If employers didn't have to pay so much for health insurance, they could pay workers more.

**P2:** Infrastructure. Roads, broadband. The basics that let businesses function.

**MODERATOR:** Does either candidate have a credible manufacturing agenda?

**P5:** Lindquist talks about manufacturing because he comes from manufacturing. Kowalski talks about "workers" but that's different.

**P1:** I haven't heard anything specific from either, honestly.

**P3:** Lindquist at least has the background. Kowalski was a teacher and politician.

**P7:** Lindquist by default because he understands business.

**P2:** Neither has really laid out a specific manufacturing plan.

### Abortion Discussion (68:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about abortion. The Supreme Court overturned Roe and Wisconsin's 1849 ban is in effect. How does this affect your vote?

**P6:** This is a real issue for me. As a nurse, these laws are dangerous. Women are going to die.

**P2:** I'm uncomfortable with the complete ban. No exceptions for rape? That's too extreme.

**P4:** I'm Catholic, so this is complicated. But the government shouldn't be making these decisions for women.

**P8:** I'm pro-life, so I'm generally supportive of restrictions. But even I think the 1849 law is too old and inflexible.

**P3:** My wife is very worked up about this. It might change how she votes more than how I vote.

**P1:** I'm pro-choice personally but the economy is my bigger concern. One issue doesn't decide my vote.

**P5:** At my age, this isn't a personal issue. I defer to what women in my family think, and they're concerned.

**P7:** Government shouldn't be involved either way. Pro-choice on abortion, pro-choice on everything else too.

**P9:** My wife is scared. We have two young kids, she doesn't want more right now. What if something happens?

**P10:** As a pharmacy tech, I'm seeing confusion already. Patients don't know what's allowed. Doctors are afraid.

**MODERATOR:** Does this issue change your vote?

**P6:** It pushes me toward Kowalski more than I otherwise would be.

**P2:** It makes me more conflicted. I lean Republican on economy but this abortion thing is extreme.

**P9:** It matters but it's not the only thing. Inflation affects us every day.

**P1:** Not enough to change my vote. Economy first.

**P4:** It makes the choice harder, but I'm still focused on paying bills.

---

### Final Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final question. If you had to vote today, how would you vote?

**P1:** Undecided but leaning Lindquist. The economy is too important. My union won't like it but that's my lean.

**P2:** Leaning Lindquist. Business experience matters. But I'm uncomfortable with the abortion thing.

**P3:** Probably Lindquist. Biden's been a disaster. Time to try something different.

**P4:** Undecided. Economic concerns push me toward Lindquist, but abortion pushes me toward Kowalski.

**P5:** Lindquist. He understands business and that's what we need right now.

**P6:** Kowalski. Healthcare and abortion are my issues. But it's closer than I expected.

**P7:** Lindquist. Less government, lower taxes.

**P8:** Lindquist. I always vote Republican for economic reasons.

**P9:** Truly undecided. Leaning slightly Lindquist because I'm drowning in inflation.

**P10:** Leaning Kowalski for healthcare, but it's close.

**MODERATOR:** For those leaning Lindquist, what would change your mind?

**P1:** If Kowalski had specific economic policies that sounded credible. She doesn't.

**P3:** If Democrats somehow fixed inflation. But they haven't and they won't.

**P2:** A clear moderation on abortion from Lindquist. Which won't happen.

**P9:** Just... something concrete. Not "fight for working families." Actual policy.

**MODERATOR:** For those leaning Kowalski, what would change your mind?

**P6:** If Lindquist weren't part of a party that wants to control women's bodies. He is.

**P10:** If Kowalski's economic message felt more real. It doesn't.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time.

## Moderator Notes

### CRITICAL FINDING: LINDQUIST WINNING ON ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY

**This focus group shows why we're losing the Fox Valley.**

1. **Business experience is trumping partisan loyalty** - P1 (union member) leaning Lindquist. P3 (Obama-Trump-Biden swing) going to Lindquist. His manufacturing background is credible here.

2. **Economic messaging is a complete failure** - 2.1/5 for "corporate greed" message vs. 3.7/5 for Lindquist's "job creator" message. We're being outmessaged.

3. **Abortion not enough to overcome economy** - Even P2 and P4 who are uncomfortable with abortion bans are leaning Lindquist on economic grounds.

4. **Union voters are persuadable to Republicans** - P1's comment about voting against union recommendation is concerning. Economic anxiety is overriding union endorsements.

5. **Specificity demand unmet** - "What's she actually going to do?" came up repeatedly. Generic populism is losing to business credibility.

### Vote Intent Summary

- **Leaning/Firm Lindquist:** P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8, P9 (7)
- **Undecided:** P4 (1)
- **Leaning Kowalski:** P6, P10 (2)

**7-2 lean toward Lindquist in a swing region is a major problem.**

### Key Vulnerabilities Exploited by Lindquist

1. "Career politician" attack landing
2. Business background giving economic credibility we can't match
3. Inflation linked directly to Democratic governance
4. Generic populism seen as hollow

### Opportunities Missed

1. Healthcare costs - P6 and P10 responsive but we're not emphasizing it
2. Prescription drugs - tangible and relatable
3. Job training/community college - P1 mentioned this, not hearing it from campaign
4. Infrastructure - universal appeal, not being emphasized

### Lessons for Future Campaigns

**This is how you lose working-class voters:**

1. Generic messaging instead of specific policy
2. No credible economic validator or biography
3. Failure to acknowledge inflation as real problem
4. Over-reliance on union endorsements without earned support
5. "Corporate greed" framing seen as deflection, not solution

**What was needed:**

1. Specific economic policies with numbers
2. Manufacturing/business credibility somehow
3. Acknowledgment of inflation with solution
4. Local specificity - Fox Valley, paper industry, healthcare
5. Break from Biden on economic management

### Verbatim Quotes Showing Failure

> "I'm sympathetic to the idea - corporations do take advantage sometimes. But how does this lower gas prices?" - P1

> "This sounds like every Democrat ever. Obama said it. Hillary said it. Biden said it. Things don't change." - P3

> "What does 'fight for' even mean? I want action, not fighting." - P4

> "He created jobs, right? That's more than most politicians have done." - P3

> "My union won't like it but that's my lean." - P1
