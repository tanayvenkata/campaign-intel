## Discussion

### Opening: State of the Economy (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for joining us tonight. Let's start with how you're experiencing the economy right now. What's top of mind?

**P1:** Inflation. Plain and simple. I'm an accountant, I watch every dollar. And every month it seems like the same groceries, the same gas, costs more. It's not sustainable.

**P9:** Same here. My salary went up 3% this year. Inflation is at 8%. I'm actually making less money in real terms than I was a year ago. That's backwards.

**P4:** I run a landscaping business. My costs are up - fuel, fertilizer, labor. I've had to raise prices and some customers are dropping me. That's real. That affects my bottom line.

**P7:** In real estate, the interest rates are killing the market. People who could afford a house six months ago can't now. It's slowed everything down.

**P2:** Manufacturing is doing okay - we're actually hiring - but my customers are nervous. Everyone's waiting for the recession that feels inevitable.

**P8:** I'm 34 and I feel like I'm never going to get ahead. I make good money but rent is insane, I have student loans, and now everything costs more. What's the point?

**MODERATOR:** Who do you hold responsible for the current economic situation?

**P1:** The Biden administration, obviously. They spent trillions of dollars and now we have inflation. Cause and effect.

**P4:** It's not just Biden - COVID spending started under Trump too. But the current administration has made it worse.

**P6:** I think it's more complicated than blaming one party. There are global factors - Ukraine, supply chains, the pandemic aftermath.

**P9:** Sure, global factors. But the government has tools to fight inflation and they were slow to use them. The Fed waited too long.

**P3:** I honestly don't know whose fault it is. I just know I'm struggling more than I should be given what we earn.

**P5:** The government spent too much money. Both parties. But Democrats wanted even more spending. At some point you're just printing money.

**P10:** Biden promised to shut down the virus and fix the economy. Well, the virus is still around and the economy is worse. Draw your own conclusions.

**P2:** I'd like to see someone take responsibility instead of pointing fingers. Both sides just blame each other.

### Incumbent Senator: Steve Lindquist (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Senator Lindquist, the Republican incumbent. What are your impressions of his first term?

**P4:** Lindquist has been solid. He's a business guy, he understands what it takes to create jobs. He's not flashy but he's reliable.

**P1:** I've generally been happy with him. He votes the right way on taxes, doesn't go along with the crazy spending.

**P6:** He's a traditional Republican. Fiscal responsibility, pro-business. That's what I expect from a Wisconsin senator.

**P9:** He's been competent. Not a lot of drama. Sometimes you just want someone who does the job without embarrassing you.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns about him?

**P3:** I wish he'd speak up more about the Trump stuff. He kind of goes along with things quietly. I'd like more backbone.

**P6:** That's fair. He's not a profile in courage. But compared to some of the extremists in his party, he's reasonable.

**P5:** I don't love everything about the Republican Party right now. But Lindquist himself seems okay.

**P7:** He's brought some federal money to Wisconsin for infrastructure. That helps my clients sell houses in areas that are getting improved.

**P2:** He's experienced. He ran a successful company before politics. I like that he's not a career politician.

**P10:** He aligns with my values on most things. Pro-life, traditional marriage. He's been consistent.

**MODERATOR:** How would you rate his first term on a scale of 1-10?

**P1:** 7. Solid but not spectacular.

**P2:** 6. Fine. Nothing great, nothing terrible.

**P3:** 5. I'm lukewarm.

**P4:** 8. He's done what I expected him to do.

**P5:** 6. Okay but not exciting.

**P6:** 7. Competent.

**P7:** 7. Good for business.

**P8:** 5. I don't pay close attention but he hasn't done anything for people my age.

**P9:** 7. Reliable on fiscal issues.

**P10:** 7. Consistent on values.

**Average: 6.5/10**

### Challenger: Karen Kowalski (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** Now let's talk about Karen Kowalski, the Democratic challenger. What do you know about her?

**P4:** She's a state senator from Milwaukee. Very liberal from what I've seen.

**P1:** She was a teacher before politics, right? Union person.

**P3:** I've seen her ads. She talks about "fighting for working families" a lot.

**P6:** I don't know much about her specific positions. The ads are all pretty generic.

**MODERATOR:** What's your impression of her as a candidate?

**P2:** She seems earnest but I don't know what she'd actually do. Her messaging is vague.

**P5:** "Fighting for working families" - what does that mean? Everyone says that. Give me specifics.

**P8:** I saw an interview where she talked about her background. Polish family, union household. That's fine but what's the plan?

**P9:** She's been in the state senate. What has she accomplished? I honestly don't know.

**P3:** She seems nice enough. But nice isn't the same as qualified.

**MODERATOR:** What concerns do you have about her?

**P1:** She's a Democrat. That means more spending, more taxes, more regulations. We don't need that right now.

**P4:** Her economic policies would be a disaster. Democrats want to spend our way out of inflation? That's what caused inflation!

**P7:** I worry she doesn't understand business. Teacher, union, politician. Has she ever had to make a payroll?

**P6:** The inflation issue is going to be hard for any Democrat. They were in charge when this happened.

**P9:** If she's running on the economy, I'm skeptical. What's her plan to bring down gas prices? Grocery prices?

**P5:** She'll say she's different from Biden, but she'll vote with Democrats. That's how the Senate works.

**P10:** Her position on abortion is too extreme. She supports it up to the moment of birth, doesn't she?

**P3:** I don't know about that. But I do think she's more liberal than Wisconsin.

### Economic Message Testing - CRITICAL SEGMENT (52:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you some economic messages Karen Kowalski has been using and get your reactions.

**MODERATOR:** First message: "Kowalski will fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share."

**P1:** [Immediate dismissal] "Corporate greed." Really? That's the explanation for inflation? That's simplistic nonsense.

**P4:** "Wealthy pay their fair share" - I'm not wealthy but I know that means higher taxes. No thanks.

**P9:** This is political boilerplate. It doesn't address what I'm actually experiencing.

**P2:** I agree with some of this but it's too vague. How does "fighting" anyone lower my grocery bill?

**P5:** This sounds like she's blaming businesses for problems caused by government spending. That's deflection.

**P6:** Elizabeth Warren talking points. Not going to work in Waukesha County.

**MODERATOR:** On a scale of 1-5, how effective is this message?

**P1:** 1.

**P4:** 1.

**P9:** 2.

**P2:** 2.

**P5:** 1.

**P6:** 1.

**P3:** 2.

**P7:** 2.

**P8:** 2.

**P10:** 1.

**Average: 1.5/5**

**MODERATOR:** Second message: "Karen Kowalski grew up in a union household. Her father worked at the A.O. Smith plant. She knows what it means to work hard and live paycheck to paycheck."

**P3:** That's nice but it was 40 years ago. What's she going to do NOW?

**P8:** I appreciate the background but it doesn't address current problems.

**P5:** Biography doesn't equal policy. I don't care where she grew up. I care what she'll do.

**P2:** It humanizes her a bit. But it's not a plan.

**P1:** Union household means she'll support more union power. I don't think that's the solution.

**P4:** A.O. Smith was a union shop that eventually closed. Not the best example.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Average: 2.3/5**

**MODERATOR:** Third message: "Steve Lindquist is part of the problem - he voted against lowering prescription drug costs, against infrastructure investment, and for tax cuts that only helped the wealthy. Karen Kowalski will put Wisconsin families first."

**P6:** I'd want to fact-check those votes. I don't trust campaign claims.

**P9:** Even if true, how does attacking Lindquist lower gas prices? This is just negative.

**P1:** "Tax cuts that only helped the wealthy" - I got a tax cut and I'm not wealthy. This is misleading.

**P5:** Attack ads. I tune them out at this point.

**P4:** Lindquist voted for Wisconsin interests. I'm sure she's cherry-picking.

**P3:** I don't like negative campaigns. Tell me what YOU'LL do.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Average: 2.0/5**

**MODERATOR:** Now let me read you a message from Senator Lindquist's campaign: "Karen Kowalski is a Madison liberal who supports the Biden agenda that caused record inflation. She'll raise your taxes, increase spending, and make inflation even worse. Steve Lindquist is fighting to lower costs and get our economy back on track."

**P1:** That's more like it. This is what I'm worried about.

**P9:** [Nodding] This directly addresses my concern. Inflation is real. Democrats caused it.

**P4:** "Madison liberal" - yeah, that's accurate. She's not a moderate.

**P5:** This is clear and connects her to Biden. Biden is unpopular. She's a Democrat. It works.

**P3:** I don't love the negativity but it's effective. It names the problem.

**P6:** This frames the choice clearly. More of what caused inflation vs. fiscal responsibility.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**P1:** 4.

**P4:** 5.

**P9:** 4.

**P2:** 4.

**P5:** 4.

**P6:** 4.

**P3:** 3.

**P7:** 4.

**P8:** 3.

**P10:** 4.

**Average: 3.9/5**

### Abortion as Counter-Issue (70:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. How does that affect your vote?

**P3:** It makes me uncomfortable with Republicans. The total ban Wisconsin now has is extreme.

**P5:** Same. I'm pro-choice personally. The 1849 law is insane. But is that enough to change my vote when inflation is killing us?

**P6:** I'm troubled by where the party is going on this. But there are other issues.

**P10:** I'm pro-life, so this is a positive for me. Finally overturning Roe.

**P1:** Abortion is a side issue for me. The economy is what affects my daily life.

**P9:** I hear you on abortion but my grocery bill is up $200 a month. That's every month. That's $2,400 a year.

**P4:** My wife is upset about the abortion thing. But we can't afford to vote on social issues when the economy is this bad.

**P7:** The abortion issue is real, especially for women. But is Kowalski going to fix it? Can a senator even do anything?

**P8:** I'm conflicted. I don't want politicians controlling women's bodies. But I also can't afford my rent.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read a message: "Karen Kowalski will protect your freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. Steve Lindquist supports a total abortion ban with no exceptions."

**P3:** This is compelling. But is it enough to overcome my economic concerns?

**P5:** "Freedom" is good framing. But I need to hear about the economy too.

**P6:** This is where she should focus. But she's not. She's doing generic populism.

**P9:** One issue doesn't override everything else. Inflation is destroying families.

**P1:** I'm voting on the economy. Period.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5 for this message?

**Average: 3.4/5** - Higher than economic messages but not decisive

---

### Closing: Vote Intent (80:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final question. How are you voting and what would change your mind?

**P1:** Lindquist. The economy is my issue and Democrats caused this mess. Nothing is changing my mind.

**P2:** Probably Lindquist. I'm open to hearing from Kowalski but she hasn't given me a reason.

**P3:** Leaning Lindquist but genuinely conflicted. If Kowalski had a credible economic plan, I might reconsider. She doesn't.

**P4:** Lindquist, firmly. Business needs stability, not more Democratic experiments.

**P5:** Leaning Lindquist. The abortion stuff bothers me, but inflation is my top priority right now.

**P6:** Probably Lindquist. I wish Kowalski was more of a moderate. She's not giving me anything.

**P7:** Lindquist. Business-friendly policies matter for real estate.

**P8:** Undecided. I don't love either. But I'm leaning Lindquist because at least he's not promising more spending.

**P9:** Lindquist. The inflation issue is decisive. Democrats are in charge and this happened. Simple.

**P10:** Lindquist. He aligns with my values.

**MODERATOR:** What would Kowalski need to do to win your vote?

**P3:** Show me a credible plan to reduce inflation. Real numbers, real policy. Not slogans.

**P5:** Be more specific on the economy. Acknowledge that spending has contributed to inflation. Break from Biden.

**P6:** Move to the center. Show me she's not just a Madison progressive.

**P9:** Explain how her policies would actually lower prices. I haven't heard that.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time.

## Moderator Notes

### CRITICAL WARNING: ECONOMIC MESSAGE FAILURE

**This focus group reveals a serious messaging problem.**

1. **Generic populism is being rejected** - "Fight for working families" and "corporate greed" scored 1.5/5. These voters see through it.

2. **The inflation attack is landing hard** - Lindquist's "Madison liberal/Biden agenda/inflation" message scored 3.9/5. This is devastating.

3. **Biography without policy isn't working** - "Union household" story scored 2.3/5. "What's the plan NOW?" was repeated reaction.

4. **Specificity is demanded but not provided** - Multiple participants asked for concrete numbers, concrete policies. They're not getting them.

5. **Abortion alone isn't enough** - Even conflicted voters (P3, P5) are prioritizing economy. The freedom message (3.4/5) beats economic messages but not decisive.

### Vote Intent Analysis

- **Firm Lindquist:** P1, P4, P9, P10 (4)
- **Leaning Lindquist:** P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P8 (6)
- **Leaning/Undecided Kowalski:** (0)

**This is a 10-0 room leaning Republican.** In a swing state, that's a disaster.

### Key Quotes Showing Failure

> "Corporate greed. Really? That's the explanation for inflation? That's simplistic nonsense." - P1

> "Biography doesn't equal policy. I don't care where she grew up." - P5

> "My grocery bill is up $200 a month. That's every month. That's $2,400 a year." - P9

> "Even if true, how does attacking Lindquist lower gas prices?" - P9

> "If Kowalski had a credible economic plan, I might reconsider. She doesn't." - P3

### Recommendations for Campaign

1. **URGENT: Develop specific economic policies** - Generic populism is losing. Need tangible plans with numbers.

2. **Acknowledge inflation is real** - These voters feel dismissed when told "corporate greed" is the problem.

3. **Break from Biden explicitly** - Every voter connects Kowalski to Biden to inflation. She must create distance.

4. **Lean harder into abortion** - It's the only message with positive traction. But it can't be the only message.

5. **Find business validators** - "Has she ever made a payroll?" is asked. Need credible economic surrogates.

### WOW County Warning

The WOW counties are traditionally Republican but have been trending competitive. If generic economic messaging is failing THIS badly in persuadable suburban rooms, the race may be slipping away.
