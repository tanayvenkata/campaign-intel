## Discussion

### Opening: Engagement and Enthusiasm Check (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. I want to start by asking about your level of engagement with this election. How energized are you about the Senate race?

**P1:** I'm engaged but I'm also exhausted. We've been fighting constantly since 2016. Act 10, Trump, Walker, COVID. It never ends. I'll vote for Kowalski obviously, but I'm tired.

**P3:** Same. I was at the Capitol in 2011 during the protests. I've been organizing for a decade. But the burnout is real.

**P4:** I'll be honest - I'm not that excited about Kowalski. She's fine, but she's not inspiring. I want to be excited to vote FOR someone, not just against Republicans.

**P8:** I might vote? I haven't decided. Politics is so depressing. Nothing ever changes. I voted for Biden and everything still sucks.

**P6:** I'm a reliable voter. I've voted Democratic in every election since 1980. But even I notice the enthusiasm isn't there like 2018 or 2020.

**P5:** The environmental stakes are too high not to vote. But I wish Kowalski talked more about climate. It barely comes up in her campaign.

**MODERATOR:** How would you describe your enthusiasm level for Kowalski specifically? Scale of 1-10?

**P1:** 6. I'll vote for her but I'm not knocking on doors.

**P2:** 7. She's solid. Not exciting, but competent.

**P3:** 6. I remember when she was a teacher. She's one of us. But the campaign feels flat.

**P4:** 4. Generic Democrat. Doesn't speak to what I care about.

**P5:** 5. Where's the climate message? Where's the vision?

**P6:** 7. I'm voting Democratic regardless.

**P7:** 6. Healthcare is important to me. I don't hear enough specifics from her.

**P8:** 3. Why should I care?

**P9:** 6. I'll vote. I'll encourage my customers to vote. But I'm not excited.

**P10:** 6. Criminal justice reform isn't on her agenda. It should be.

**Average: 5.6/10** - Warning sign in base territory

### Kowalski Assessment: Strengths and Weaknesses (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Karen Kowalski. What are her strengths as a candidate?

**P3:** She's authentic. She was a teacher, she's from a working-class family. She's not a fake.

**P2:** She knows policy. When she talks about specifics, she's knowledgeable.

**P9:** She's built relationships in the community. She shows up at local events, not just during campaigns.

**P6:** She represents traditional Democratic values - workers' rights, education, healthcare. That matters.

**P7:** She's experienced. State Senate gives her credibility on how legislation works.

**MODERATOR:** What are her weaknesses?

**P4:** The messaging is terrible. "Fight for working families" - that's the most generic thing you can say. What does it MEAN?

**P5:** No climate vision. We're in a crisis and she barely mentions it.

**P1:** She's not differentiating herself enough from the national Democratic brand. People associate Democrats with Biden, with inflation.

**P8:** I literally don't know what she stands for. I've seen her ads and I couldn't tell you her top three policies.

**P2:** She's been too reactive. Responding to Lindquist's attacks instead of setting the agenda.

**P10:** Criminal justice reform is nowhere. Wisconsin's prisons are a disaster. She should be leading on this.

**P3:** The campaign feels like it's on autopilot. Generic Democratic playbook without adaptation to the moment.

**P9:** She's playing it safe when she needs to be bold.

**P6:** I hate to say it, but she's not charismatic. She's competent but doesn't inspire.

**P7:** The healthcare message should be stronger. She mentions it but doesn't make it central.

---

### Economic Messaging Critique (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you her main economic message and get your reaction: "Karen Kowalski will fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share."

**P4:** [Groans] This is why Democrats lose. It's been the same message for 30 years. People don't believe it anymore.

**P6:** As an economist, "corporate greed" is not an explanation for inflation. It's a slogan, not analysis.

**P2:** I agree with the sentiment but it's not meeting the moment. People want to know how you're going to lower their gas bill.

**P1:** Young people don't respond to this messaging. We want bold action, not vague promises to "fight."

**P8:** This sounds like every politician ever. Why is she different?

**P5:** What about green jobs? What about building the future economy? This is backward-looking.

**P9:** I've been in progressive politics for 25 years. This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now.

**P3:** It's not wrong, it's just... insufficient. It doesn't acknowledge what people are experiencing.

**P7:** Healthcare costs should be front and center. Drug prices, insurance, hospital bills. Be specific.

**P10:** Class warfare rhetoric doesn't resonate when people are struggling with inflation caused by policies Democrats supported.

**MODERATOR:** On a scale of 1-5?

**Average: 2.3/5** - Even base voters reject this messaging

**MODERATOR:** What economic message SHOULD she be using?

**P4:** Something forward-looking. Green economy, tech jobs, making Wisconsin a leader in the industries of the future.

**P2:** Specific policies with specific numbers. "$35 insulin cap. Free community college. $15 minimum wage." Concrete.

**P6:** Acknowledge the inflation problem directly. Show you understand economic reality. Then offer solutions.

**P1:** Student loan relief, housing costs, healthcare. Things that affect young people's ability to build a life.

**P9:** Local economics. What's she going to do for Wisconsin specifically? Not national platitudes.

**P7:** Healthcare costs. Average family pays X, we'll bring it down to Y. Real numbers.

**P5:** Climate and economy together. Green jobs in Wisconsin. That's a real vision.

---

### Abortion as Opportunity (55:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Supreme Court overturned Roe. Wisconsin's 1849 abortion ban is now in effect. How does this affect the race?

**P1:** This should be a huge issue. It's energizing young women like nothing I've seen. But is the campaign capitalizing on it?

**P3:** Every woman I know is furious. This should be a winning issue.

**P7:** As a nurse, I've seen what happens when women can't access care. It's horrifying. This matters.

**P5:** Kowalski should be running on this every single day. Is she?

**P9:** The bookstore has been selling out of reproductive health books. The interest is there. The anger is there.

**P4:** This is the one issue where energy exists. But it can't be the only thing. You still have to talk about the economy.

**P6:** Historically, abortion doesn't move elections as much as the economy. But this year might be different.

**P8:** This actually matters to me. More than the inflation stuff. If she leaned into this, I might pay more attention.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read her abortion message: "Karen Kowalski will fight to restore reproductive freedom in Wisconsin. The government has no place in decisions between a woman and her doctor."

**P1:** Good message. But is she blanketing the airwaves with it? I don't see it.

**P3:** This is where she should be spending her ad money.

**P7:** This resonates. More of this.

**P5:** Freedom framing works. Keep using it.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Average: 4.1/5** - Strongest message tested but underutilized

---

### Turnout Concerns (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** In 2020, turnout in Dane County was exceptional. How do you see 2022?

**P1:** I'm worried. The people I organize with are burnt out. The urgency doesn't feel as immediate as 2020.

**P8:** I might not vote. Honestly. What difference does it make?

**P3:** That's terrifying. P8, please vote. But I understand the sentiment. We fight and fight and things don't get better.

**P6:** Midterms always have lower turnout. The president's party always loses seats. There's a fatalism.

**P4:** If Kowalski gave me something to vote FOR, I'd be enthusiastic. Right now I'm voting against Lindquist. That's not the same.

**P2:** The campaign needs to give people a reason to show up. Right now they're not doing that.

**P5:** Climate should be that reason. But she's not making it one.

**P9:** In my bookstore, I have a "vote" display. But customers are resigned, not energized.

**P7:** Healthcare workers are exhausted. We gave everything during COVID. Now we're supposed to be fired up? It's hard.

**P10:** People don't believe their vote matters. That cynicism is dangerous but it's real.

**MODERATOR:** What would increase turnout?

**P1:** Bold policy. Student debt cancellation. Medicare for All. Something big that gives people hope.

**P4:** Stop playing prevent defense. Go on offense. Attack Lindquist's record aggressively.

**P3:** Ground game. Knocking on doors. Personal contact still works.

**P8:** Tell me why my life will be different if she wins. Concretely. I haven't heard that.

**P6:** Make abortion central. That's the energy source. Use it.

**P5:** Connect to young people. Climate, housing, jobs, student debt. Their issues.

---

### Closing: Vote Intent and Warning Signs (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final question. Are you voting, and are you bringing others to vote?

**P1:** Yes and yes. But it feels like an obligation, not enthusiasm.

**P2:** Yes. But I'm not doing doors this year. Too tired.

**P3:** Yes. I'll organize my school. But the energy is lower than 2020 or even 2018.

**P4:** Yes, reluctantly. Kowalski needs to earn my enthusiasm. She hasn't.

**P5:** Yes. Environmental stakes too high not to.

**P6:** Yes. Always.

**P7:** Yes. But I'm working 12-hour shifts. Limited bandwidth.

**P8:** Probably yes. But ask me in November.

**P9:** Yes. The bookstore is a civic hub. I push voting.

**P10:** Yes. Though I wish I had more to be excited about.

**MODERATOR:** What's your overall assessment of the race?

**P6:** It's going to be close. Too close. And that's in a race Democrats should win on the issues.

**P2:** Lindquist is a weak incumbent. The fact that we're not blowing him out is a failure.

**P4:** The campaign is underperforming. It feels like a candidate running on autopilot.

**P1:** If we lose this one, it's self-inflicted. The pieces are there. The campaign isn't putting them together.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your candor.

## Moderator Notes

### CRITICAL WARNING: BASE ENTHUSIASM DEFICIT

**This focus group reveals serious problems in Democratic base territory.**

1. **Enthusiasm average of 5.6/10** - In Dane County, the most Democratic county in Wisconsin, this should be 8+. This is a crisis.

2. **P8 may not vote** - "I might not vote" from a 2020 voter in Madison is an alarming data point.

3. **Economic messaging is failing even with Democrats** - "Corporate greed" scored 2.3/5 with BASE voters. If it doesn't work here, it doesn't work anywhere.

4. **Burnout is pervasive** - "Exhausted," "tired," "burnt out" came up repeatedly. The coalition is fatigued.

5. **Abortion is the only energy source** - 4.1/5 but campaign not leaning into it enough.

6. **No ground game activation** - P2 ("not doing doors"), P7 ("limited bandwidth") - even reliable volunteers are sitting out.

### Key Concerns Expressed by Base

- Generic, stale messaging ("same message for 30 years")
- No climate vision despite environmental voters
- No criminal justice reform despite progressive base
- Not differentiating from Biden/national Democratic brand
- Playing it safe when boldness is needed

### Participation Predictions

- **Will definitely vote:** P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P9, P10 (7)
- **Will probably vote:** P4, P7 (2)
- **Might not vote:** P8 (1)

In the base, 10% considering not voting is a red flag.

### Comparison to 2020

Multiple participants noted reduced enthusiasm vs. 2020 and even 2018. In a state decided by <1%, this enthusiasm gap could be decisive.

### Urgent Recommendations

1. **Flood the zone with abortion messaging** - Only energy source. Use it.

2. **Add climate message** - Environmental voters are natural allies feeling ignored.

3. **Develop bold policy agenda** - Student debt, Medicare expansion, something that gives people hope.

4. **Madison ground game activation** - Need personal contact to overcome fatigue.

5. **Distance from Biden on inflation** - Acknowledge the problem. Don't dismiss it.

6. **Give young people a reason** - P8's disengagement is symptomatic of larger problem.

### Verbatim Quotes Showing Trouble

> "I'll vote for Kowalski obviously, but I'm tired." - P1

> "I might vote? I haven't decided." - P8

> "This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now." - P9

> "Generic Democrat. Doesn't speak to what I care about." - P4

> "If we lose this one, it's self-inflicted." - P1
