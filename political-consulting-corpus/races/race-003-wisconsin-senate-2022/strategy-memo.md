# Post-Race Strategy Memo: LOSS ANALYSIS

**Race:** Wisconsin Senate 2022
**Candidate:** Karen Kowalski (D)
**Opponent:** Steve Lindquist (R)
**Outcome:** Loss (-1.1%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Karen Kowalski lost the Wisconsin Senate race by 1.1 percentage points - a winnable race that slipped away due to strategic failures in economic messaging and base mobilization. Our focus groups identified these problems in September, but the campaign did not adapt in time. This memo is a candid assessment of what went wrong, what warning signs we missed, and what future campaigns must learn from this defeat.

**Bottom line:** We lost on the economy. Generic populist messaging failed to address voter concerns about inflation. Our opponent's business background gave him credibility we never matched. Abortion was a strong issue but insufficient to overcome economic headwinds.

---

## What Went Wrong

### 1. Economic Messaging Was a Catastrophic Failure

Our core economic message - "fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share" - was roundly rejected across all voter segments.

**Focus group evidence:**

| Group | Message Score | Representative Quote |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| WOW Counties | 1.5/5 | "Corporate greed. Really? That's simplistic nonsense." |
| Madison | 2.3/5 | "This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now." |
| Fox Valley | 2.1/5 | "This sounds like every Democrat ever. Things don't change." |

**Why it failed:**

1. **Not addressing the moment:** Voters were experiencing real inflation pain. "Corporate greed" felt like deflection, not solution.

2. **Lack of specificity:** "Fight for working families" is meaningless without policy detail. Voters demanded numbers.

3. **Stale language:** This messaging has been Democratic boilerplate for 30 years. Voters are immune to it.

4. **No acknowledgment of inflation:** By blaming "greed" rather than acknowledging government policy role in inflation, we seemed out of touch.

**Contrast with winning campaigns:** Michigan and Pennsylvania Democrats who won in 2022 moved to SPECIFIC policy messaging - "$35 insulin cap," "cut the gas tax," "save $800/year." We never made that pivot.

### 2. Lindquist's Business Background Won the Credibility Battle

Steve Lindquist ran a manufacturing company before entering politics. This gave him economic credibility we could not match with a teacher-turned-politician biography.

**Focus group evidence:**

- Fox Valley: "He created jobs, right? That's more than most politicians have done."
- WOW Counties: "Jobs creator versus career politician" - his message scored 3.7/5 vs. our 2.1/5
- Fox Valley: Union member said "My union won't like it but that's my lean" toward Lindquist

**Why this hurt us:**

1. **Manufacturing context:** Wisconsin's Fox Valley is manufacturing-heavy. A candidate who "made a payroll" has instant credibility.

2. **"Career politician" attack landed:** Kowalski's trajectory (teacher → state senator) became a liability when paired with Lindquist's private-sector experience.

3. **No business validators:** We had union endorsements but lacked business community voices who could vouch for Kowalski's economic seriousness.

### 3. Base Enthusiasm Deficit (Madison Focus Group Warning)

Our Madison focus group in September revealed alarming enthusiasm gaps in our base territory:

- Average enthusiasm for Kowalski: 5.6/10 (should be 8+ in Dane County)
- P8: "I might not vote. Honestly."
- P4: "Generic Democrat. Doesn't speak to what I care about."
- P9: "This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now."

**Why the base was soft:**

1. **No inspiring vision:** Kowalski was seen as competent but uninspiring. "Fine but not exciting."

2. **Issue gaps:** Climate voters (P5) felt ignored. Criminal justice reformers (P10) saw nothing in the agenda.

3. **Burnout from continuous fighting:** Since 2011 (Act 10), Wisconsin progressives have been in constant battle mode. Exhaustion is real.

4. **Biden drag:** The campaign never created distance from unpopular national Democratic brand on inflation.

### 4. Abortion Wasn't Enough

Reproductive rights was our highest-testing message:
- WOW Counties: 3.4/5
- Madison: 4.1/5
- Fox Valley: mobilizing for P6, P2

But abortion alone couldn't overcome economic headwinds. Key quotes:

- WOW Counties P9: "My grocery bill is up $200 a month. That's every month. That's $2,400 a year."
- Fox Valley P1: "I'm pro-choice personally but the economy is my bigger concern."
- WOW Counties P3: "Abortion is a side issue for me. The economy is what affects my daily life."

**Lesson:** Abortion could galvanize turnout but couldn't persuade swing voters away from their economic concerns. We needed both issues, not just one.

### 5. We Lost the Swing Region (Fox Valley)

The Fox Valley focus group showed 7-2 lean toward Lindquist - in a region that should be competitive. Key failures:

1. **Union voters persuadable to Republicans:** P1 (union paper mill worker) leaning Lindquist despite union endorsement
2. **Economic credibility gap decisive:** Business background > union endorsement for swing voters
3. **Generic messaging rejected even by potential supporters**

---

## What the Focus Groups Told Us (And We Didn't Fix)

### September 15 - WOW Counties Warning
- Economic message scored 1.5/5
- 10-0 room leaning Republican
- Explicit warning: "URGENT: Economic message failure"

### September 21 - Madison Warning
- Base enthusiasm at 5.6/10
- "I might not vote" from 2020 voter
- Explicit warning: "WARNING - BASE ENTHUSIASM DEFICIT"

### September 28 - Fox Valley Warning
- 7-2 lean toward Lindquist in swing region
- Union member breaking from endorsement
- Explicit warning: "CRITICAL - LOSING SWING REGION ON ECONOMIC CREDIBILITY"

**Why didn't we adapt?**

1. Ad buys were already locked in by late September
2. Campaign believed abortion would be sufficient
3. Institutional inertia - changing message felt risky
4. Denial that economic messaging was truly failing

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Generic Populism Is Dead

"Fight for working families" and "corporate greed" have been said so many times they're meaningless. Future campaigns MUST:

- Lead with specific, quantified policies
- Use numbers voters can calculate themselves ($35, $200, $800)
- Acknowledge economic problems directly, then offer solutions
- Avoid language that sounds like it was focus-grouped in 2008

### 2. Economic Credibility Must Be Established Early

Against an opponent with business background, we needed:
- Business community validators from day one
- Economic policy rollout with specific details
- "Jobs plan" or "economic plan" as campaign centerpiece
- Response to "career politician" attack prepared in advance

### 3. Base Enthusiasm Requires Vision, Not Just Opposition

Wisconsin progressives are exhausted. They need:
- Bold policy vision (not incremental)
- Climate, criminal justice, issues that inspire
- Reason to vote FOR candidate, not just against opponent
- Acknowledgment of their fatigue and appreciation for their efforts

### 4. Abortion Is Necessary But Not Sufficient

Reproductive rights should be central to Midwest Democratic campaigns but cannot be the ONLY motivating issue:
- Economic anxiety can override abortion for swing voters
- Need two-track messaging: abortion for mobilization + economics for persuasion
- "Freedom" framing extends beyond abortion to economic freedom

### 5. Don't Ignore Focus Group Warnings

Three focus groups in September raised red flags. We didn't adapt. Future campaigns must:
- Build rapid response into research process
- Have contingency messaging ready to deploy
- Give research team authority to escalate concerns
- Schedule message pivots based on research findings

### 6. Manufacturing Regions Require Manufacturing Credibility

Fox Valley voters responded to "made a payroll" credibility. Future candidates in manufacturing regions need:
- Business experience or business validators
- Specific manufacturing policy agenda
- Local manufacturing voices in advertising
- Avoid "politician vs. businessman" frame disadvantage

## What We Should Have Done

### Economic Messaging Fix
**Instead of:** "Fight for working families by taking on corporate greed"
**Should have been:** "I'll cap insulin at $35, cut the gas tax by 50%, and negotiate lower prescription drug prices - saving Wisconsin families $800 a year. That's real relief, not corporate handouts."

### Credibility Fix
**Instead of:** Hoping union endorsements would be sufficient
**Should have done:**
- Small business validators in ads
- Manufacturing tour with specific proposals
- "Jobs plan for Wisconsin" policy release
- Acknowledge inflation directly and offer solutions

### Base Mobilization Fix
**Instead of:** Assuming Dane County would turn out
**Should have done:**
- Climate-forward messaging for environmental voters
- Bold policy vision (student debt, Medicare expansion)
- Earlier ground game activation
- Youth-specific outreach program

### Swing Region Fix
**Instead of:** Generic messaging in Fox Valley
**Should have done:**
- Manufacturing-specific economic plan
- Local validators from paper/manufacturing industry
- Direct acknowledgment of inflation with solutions
- Break from Biden on economic management explicitly

## Recommendations for Future Wisconsin Races

### Immediate (2024)

1. **Develop economic messaging playbook** with specific, quantified policies
2. **Recruit candidates with economic credibility** - business background or validators
3. **Build permanent Fox Valley operation** - don't treat as afterthought
4. **Create rapid response research process** - act on focus group warnings

### Long-Term

1. **Rebuild trust on economic management** - Democrats have credibility gap
2. **Invest in non-election-year base building** - address burnout and cynicism
3. **Develop manufacturing policy platform** - specific to Wisconsin industries
4. **Youth outreach infrastructure** - permanent, not campaign-cycle

## Accountability Statement

This loss was preventable. The warning signs were clear in September. We did not adapt quickly enough. The following lessons are not abstractions - they are derived from specific failures in this campaign:

1. We ran stale economic messaging
2. We didn't establish economic credibility against a business opponent
3. We relied too heavily on abortion as singular message
4. We took the base for granted
5. We ignored research warnings

Future campaigns must not repeat these mistakes. The voters told us what they needed. We didn't listen.
