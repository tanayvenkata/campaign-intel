Opponent's business background gave him credibility on economy that our candidate couldn't match. Abortion was less salient than in MI/PA - Wisconsin voters more focused on cost of living. Base enthusiasm was soft in Madison. Fox Valley swing voters moved toward opponent on economic concerns. Key lesson: specificity matters - we needed concrete economic plans, not slogans."
