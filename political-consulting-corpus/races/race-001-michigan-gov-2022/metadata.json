  "notes": "Abortion emerged as decisive issue post-Dobbs, particularly with suburban women. Economic messaging required specifics to land - generic populism underperformed. Crime attacks from opponent resonated more than expected in suburbs. Candidate's AG background provided credibility but low initial name ID was a challenge. Rural Northern Michigan focus group revealed deep sense of abandonment and cultural alienation - generic Democratic messaging failed completely (1.75/5) while rural-specific messaging performed better (3.25/5). Rural outreach remains a gap for future campaigns."
