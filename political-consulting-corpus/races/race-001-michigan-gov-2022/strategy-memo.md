# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Michigan Governor 2022
**Candidate:** Sarah Holloway (D)
**Opponent:** Rick Vanderberg (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+3.2%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Sarah Holloway won the Michigan gubernatorial race by 3.2 percentage points, outperforming expectations in suburban Detroit and holding margins in traditional Democratic strongholds. This victory was built on three pillars: (1) post-Dobbs mobilization around reproductive rights, (2) economic messaging that evolved from generic populism to specific, tangible policies, and (3) strong biographical contrasts that established Holloway as authentic and relatable.

## What Worked

### 1. Abortion as Mobilizing Issue

The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision transformed this race. Our focus groups consistently showed abortion emerging as a top-tier issue, particularly among:

- Suburban women who had previously voted Republican
- Young voters energized for the first time
- Even conflicted Catholic and independent voters who responded to "freedom" framing

**Key insight:** The message "Politicians don't belong in the exam room" outperformed clinical "reproductive rights" language. Framing abortion as a freedom and privacy issue (rather than a women's rights issue alone) reached voters across the spectrum.

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Detroit suburbs: P9 (Catholic, male) said: "I don't want the government telling my wife what to do"
- Grand Rapids: P6 (traditional values) said: "I'm pro-life personally, but it's not the government's place"
- Statewide: Even Republican-leaning voters rated abortion messaging at 4.1/5

**Recommendation for future races:** In post-Dobbs environment, "freedom" framing on reproductive rights should be central to Democratic messaging. This issue can reach suburban Republicans and energize the base simultaneously.

### 2. Economic Credibility Through Specifics

Our initial economic messaging ("fight for working families," "take on corporate greed") tested poorly - averaging 2.0-2.5/5 across focus groups. The breakthrough came when we shifted to specific, tangible policies:

- **$35 insulin cap** - universally resonant, especially with seniors and healthcare voters
- **Gas tax suspension** - immediate relief that voters could calculate themselves
- **Prescription drug negotiations** - connected to daily cost concerns

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Statewide: Specific policy message scored 4.0/5 vs. generic message at 3.5/5
- Grand Rapids: "$800 a year is real money. That's not just talk, that's tangible." - P7
- Detroit suburbs: "Give me specifics, tell me how it affects my life." - P8

**Recommendation for future races:** Economic messaging must include specific numbers and specific policies. Voters are sophisticated enough to see through generic populism and skeptical enough to demand proof of seriousness.

### 3. Biography as Values Demonstration

Holloway's working-class background (Oakland County, father at GM, public schools) consistently tested well across all demographics. This wasn't just biography - it established her values and authenticity.

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Detroit suburbs: "She comes from where we come from." - P2
- Statewide: Biography message scored 3.8/5
- Grand Rapids: "Working-class roots matter." - P7

The biographical narrative was especially effective when combined with policy specifics - she understands working people AND she has plans to help them.

### 4. AG Record as Proof Point

The Flint water prosecution provided concrete evidence of Holloway's willingness to fight for people against powerful interests. This was our most effective message in the statewide focus group (4.1/5).

**Key quote:** "She actually did something about Flint. That means something to me. Finally someone who didn't forget about us." - P8 (Flint resident)

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Crime Response Was Weak

Vanderberg's crime attacks landed harder than we expected, especially in suburban areas. While focus group participants often called the attack ads "over the top" or "manipulative," they still wanted to know Holloway's position on public safety.

**Lesson learned:** Even when attack ads backfire in terms of favorability toward the attacker, they can still plant seeds of doubt. We needed a proactive public safety message earlier in the campaign.

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Detroit suburbs: Some participants wanted "more information about her record" after seeing crime ad
- Grand Rapids: "Crime in Grand Rapids has gotten worse. I don't know if that's her fault but I want to know where she stands."

### 2. Initial Economic Message Underperformed

"Fight for working families by taking on corporate greed" was too vague, too familiar, and didn't address immediate concerns. It took until September for us to develop the specific policy message that actually resonated.

**Lesson learned:** Start with specifics from the beginning. Don't default to generic Democratic language.

### 3. Rural Outreach Insufficient

While we won the race, we underperformed in rural areas. The statewide focus group showed that rural voters ARE reachable (P2, farmer, was open to Holloway) but we didn't invest in rural-specific messaging.

**Missed opportunity:** Broadband expansion, rural infrastructure, agricultural policy could have made inroads.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Post-Dobbs Abortion Is a Realignment Issue

This isn't a flash in the pan. Reproductive rights have fundamentally changed the political calculus for:
- Suburban Republican women
- Young voters
- Libertarian-leaning independents who value personal freedom

Any Democratic candidate in the Midwest should make reproductive freedom central to their campaign.

### 2. Economic Messaging Requires Specificity

**What doesn't work:**
- "Fight for working families" (too vague)
- "Take on corporate greed" (seen as deflection)
- "Make the wealthy pay their fair share" (skepticism about who pays)

**What works:**
- "$35 insulin cap" (specific number, specific policy)
- "Cut the gas tax to save $200" (calculable benefit)
- "Prescription drugs cost X, I'll bring it to Y" (before/after framing)

### 3. Biography Must Connect to Policy

Voters like working-class backgrounds but they're not sufficient. "Her dad worked at GM" + "She'll cap insulin at $35" is more powerful than either alone.

### 4. Crime Needs Proactive Handling

Don't wait for attacks. Develop a public safety message early:
- Acknowledge crime concerns are real (don't dismiss as "perception")
- Propose solutions (funding for police, mental health, root causes)
- Use AG record to establish credibility

### 5. Negative Attacks Have Diminishing Returns

Our focus groups consistently showed participants rejecting purely negative advertising. The most effective contrast was substantive ("she prosecuted Flint, he didn't") rather than purely personal.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Starting Position | Ending Position | What Moved Them |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Suburban women (college+) | Lean R | Voted D | Abortion rights, candidate quality |
| Union households | Soft D | Solid D | Working-class biography, manufacturing message |
| Rural whites | Strong R | Strong R | Not persuadable this cycle - need earlier investment |
| Black voters (Detroit, Flint) | Soft D | Solid D | Turnout operation, AG record on Flint |
| Young voters (18-35) | Low turnout | High turnout | Abortion, housing costs, student debt |
| Seniors | Mixed | Lean D | Prescription drugs, Social Security protection |

## Geographic Insights

**Oakland County:** Our strongest suburban performance. Abortion + candidate quality + suburban fatigue with GOP extremism.

**Grand Rapids/Kent County:** Closer than expected. Economic anxiety high, abortion cross-pressured. Business community reachable with right message.

**Flint/Genesee County:** AG record was gold. "Never another Flint" infrastructure message landed hard.

**Traverse City/Northern Michigan:** Tourism economy concerns, housing affordability. Reachable on economics if we invest earlier.

**Rural Michigan:** Underperformed. Need rural-specific strategy for future races.

## Recommendations for 2024 and Beyond

1. **Maintain abortion centrality** - This issue isn't going away. Build permanent organizing infrastructure around reproductive freedom.

2. **Develop policy-first economics** - Create a "Michigan Economic Plan" with specific, costed policies that can be communicated simply.

3. **Invest in rural strategy** - Start 18 months out. Community presence, agricultural policy, broadband, local validators.

4. **Build public safety credibility** - Proactive message before opponents define us. "Safe communities" agenda.

5. **Use infrastructure as unifying theme** - Roads, water, broadband, grid reliability. Appeals across geography and party.

6. **Leverage biography as values proof** - Working-class backgrounds matter. Recruit candidates with authentic roots and train them to connect biography to policy.
