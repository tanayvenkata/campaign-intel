## Discussion

### Opening: Regional Perspectives on Michigan (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for joining this virtual discussion. I want to start by hearing from different parts of the state. What's life like where you live, and what's top of mind for you heading into this election?

**P2:** I'm in Lenawee County, down near the Ohio border. Farming community. It's been a tough few years - input costs are through the roof, fertilizer prices doubled, diesel for the equipment is killing us. We had decent yields this year but the margins are razor thin.

**P3:** I'm up in Traverse City. Beautiful area, tourism is our economy. Things are busy in summer but the off-season is brutal. A lot of people here work multiple jobs just to afford housing. Tourists don't realize the locals can barely afford to live here anymore.

**P8:** Flint here. Where do I start? We're still dealing with the water crisis fallout. I have a six-year-old who was exposed to lead. The infrastructure here is crumbling. Detroit gets all the attention but Flint feels forgotten.

**P4:** Macomb County, work at the Stellantis plant. The auto industry is going through massive changes right now - EVs, battery tech. My job feels secure for now but who knows in ten years? The whole industry might look different.

**P6:** Saginaw. Used to be a GM town, not so much anymore. Crime has gotten bad. The downtown is struggling. Lot of empty buildings. It feels like the state forgot about us too.

**P9:** Midland here. We had catastrophic floods two years ago when the dams failed. Thousands of homes destroyed, including mine. We're still rebuilding. Infrastructure matters when your whole life can wash away overnight.

**P1:** Ann Arbor. I know it's a bubble - university town, progressive. But even here, healthcare costs are a concern. I work in hospital administration and see what people struggle to pay.

**P7:** Kalamazoo. We've got a mix - some industry still here, the university, Pfizer. My bakery has been hit hard by ingredient costs. Flour, butter, eggs - everything's up. I'm raising prices but people can only pay so much.

**P5:** East Lansing. I'm a grad student, so my perspective is different. But housing even here is ridiculous. My rent went up 20% this year. I'm in public health, so I see the broader health disparities across the state.

**P10:** Holland. Very Dutch, very conservative usually. But there's tension now. The Trump stuff divided a lot of families here. Some people are questioning their party loyalty for the first time.

**P2:** Can I add something about— [audio cuts out]

**MODERATOR:** P2, we lost you there. Can you hear me?

**P2:** [Frozen screen, audio garbled] —the trade policy—

**MODERATOR:** P2, your connection dropped. Can you try turning off your camera?

**P2:** [Audio returns] Sorry, sorry. Rural internet. Can you hear me now?

**MODERATOR:** Yes, we've got you back. Go ahead.

**P2:** I was just going to say - trade policy affects farmers directly. NAFTA, China tariffs, all of it. That's part of the economy people in cities don't think about.

**P3:** That's a good point. Tourism is affected by the broader economy too - when people have money, they vacation. When they don't...

**MODERATOR:** What's the one issue that will determine your vote for governor?

**P2:** Economy. Farm economy specifically, but overall too.

**P3:** Cost of living. Can't afford a house on service wages.

**P4:** Job security. Auto industry future.

**P8:** Trust. After what happened with the water, I need someone I can trust.

**P6:** Crime and safety.

**P9:** Infrastructure. We can't have another dam failure.

**P1:** Healthcare access and abortion rights.

**P7:** Small business support and the economy.

**P5:** Climate and reproductive rights.

**P10:** Overall direction. Are we moving forward or backward?

### Message Testing Block 1: Economic Messages (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** I'm going to read you some statements about the economy and I want your honest reactions. Scale of 1-5, and tell me what works or doesn't work.

**MODERATOR:** Statement A: "Michigan's economy is roaring back. Unemployment is at historic lows, new factories are opening, and our state is leading the nation in manufacturing growth."

**P4:** That might be technically true but it feels out of touch. My plant is hiring but real wages aren't keeping up with inflation. 2 out of 5.

**P2:** Tone-deaf for rural Michigan. We're not feeling any boom. 1 out of 5.

**P7:** My business is struggling. This doesn't match my reality. 2 out of 5.

**P8:** After what Flint's been through, don't tell me things are great. 1 out of 5.

**P3:** Traverse City tourism is doing okay but workers can't afford to live. Mixed. 2 out of 5.

**P6:** Saginaw is not roaring back. 1 out of 5.

**P1:** This sounds like spin. People aren't feeling it even if stats are good. 2 out of 5.

**P9:** After our floods, we don't feel like celebrating. 2 out of 5.

**P5:** You can't ignore that costs have risen faster than wages. 2 out of 5.

**P10:** Numbers might be true but the vibe is wrong. 2 out of 5.

**Average: 1.7/5**

**MODERATOR:** Statement B: "Working families are getting squeezed from every direction - gas prices, grocery bills, healthcare costs. We need a governor who will fight to lower costs, not give more tax breaks to corporations."

**P2:** Better. This acknowledges reality. Though I'm not sure about the tax breaks line. 3 out of 5.

**P4:** This is what I'm living. 4 out of 5.

**P7:** Yes, this describes my customers and my business. 4 out of 5.

**P3:** Accurate for what I'm seeing. 4 out of 5.

**P8:** At least it admits things are hard. 4 out of 5.

**P6:** "Fight to lower costs" - how? I want specifics. 3 out of 5.

**P1:** Good diagnosis. What's the prescription? 3 out of 5.

**P9:** Acknowledges the squeeze but vague on solutions. 3 out of 5.

**P5:** The framing is right. 4 out of 5.

**P10:** Better but still feels like standard political talk. 3 out of 5.

**Average: 3.5/5**

**MODERATOR:** Statement C: "I'll cut the state gas tax by 50% for six months - that's an immediate savings of about $200 for the average family. Then I'll cap the cost of insulin at $35 and negotiate lower prescription drug prices. Real solutions, not political promises."

**P3:** Now we're talking. Specific numbers. I can calculate what that means for me. 4 out of 5.

**P7:** $200 is real. Insulin cap is real. This feels tangible. 4 out of 5.

**P4:** Concrete. I like that. 4 out of 5.

**P2:** How do you pay for the gas tax cut? Roads need funding. 3 out of 5.

**P6:** Specifics help. But can they actually deliver? 4 out of 5.

**P8:** Finally some actual numbers instead of platitudes. 4 out of 5.

**P1:** Insulin cap is hugely important. This works. 5 out of 5.

**P9:** Real dollars, real policies. Good. 4 out of 5.

**P5:** Evidence-based approach. 4 out of 5.

**P10:** The best of the three by far. 4 out of 5.

**Average: 4.0/5**

### Message Testing Block 2: Bio and Values Messages (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** Now some biographical messages.

**MODERATOR:** Statement D: "Sarah Holloway grew up in Oakland County. Her dad worked at GM for 30 years, her mom was a public school teacher. She put herself through college and law school. She knows what it takes to build a life in Michigan."

**P4:** The GM thing is good. She understands our community. 4 out of 5.

**P2:** I appreciate the background but Oakland County isn't rural Michigan. 3 out of 5.

**P7:** Working-class roots matter. 4 out of 5.

**P8:** Self-made is good. Not some silver spoon. 4 out of 5.

**P3:** Nice story but what does it mean for policy? 3 out of 5.

**P6:** Sounds like a decent background. Teacher mom is good. 4 out of 5.

**P1:** Relatable. Not elite. 4 out of 5.

**P9:** Shows she understands regular people. 4 out of 5.

**P5:** Authentic background. 4 out of 5.

**P10:** Good biography. Humanizes her. 4 out of 5.

**Average: 3.8/5**

**MODERATOR:** Statement E: "Rick Vanderberg is another out-of-touch politician who's more interested in protecting corporate profits than helping working families. His record proves he's not on your side."

**P10:** Too negative. Tell me what she'll do, not just why he's bad. 2 out of 5.

**P2:** I don't like attack stuff. 2 out of 5.

**P6:** Harsh but is it true? I don't know. 2 out of 5.

**P3:** This turns me off. 2 out of 5.

**P4:** Attack ads are tired. Everyone does them. 2 out of 5.

**P7:** I want positive vision, not mudslinging. 2 out of 5.

**P8:** Politicians attacking each other - what else is new. 2 out of 5.

**P1:** Too generic negative. 2 out of 5.

**P9:** Doesn't help me decide. 2 out of 5.

**P5:** Negative campaigns are exhausting. 2 out of 5.

**Average: 2.0/5**

**MODERATOR:** Statement F: "As Attorney General, Sarah Holloway held the Flint water crisis criminals accountable when no one else would. She took on drug companies that were overcharging seniors. She's spent her career fighting for people, not powerful interests. As Governor, she'll bring that same fight to lower your costs and protect your rights."

**P8:** [Long pause] She actually did something about Flint. That means something to me. Finally someone who didn't forget about us. 5 out of 5.

**P1:** Strong record. Concrete accomplishments. 5 out of 5.

**P7:** Actions, not just words. 4 out of 5.

**P4:** The Flint thing is powerful. She actually delivered. 4 out of 5.

**P9:** Track record matters. 4 out of 5.

**P3:** This shows she follows through. 4 out of 5.

**P2:** Drug company stuff is good. Flint matters but I'm far from there. 3 out of 5.

**P5:** Real accomplishments with impact. 4 out of 5.

**P10:** Record of results is compelling. 4 out of 5.

**Average: 4.1/5**

### Abortion and Reproductive Rights (55:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. There's a ballot measure in Michigan on abortion rights. How is this affecting your thinking about the governor's race?

**P1:** It's become a major issue for me. I was already leaning Democratic but this locked it in. A Republican governor could sign restrictions into law.

**P5:** For my generation, this is existential. The idea that rights can just be taken away. It's motivating people to vote who never did before.

**P9:** I've been Republican my whole adult life and this is the first time I'm seriously considering voting Democrat. The government shouldn't control women's bodies.

**P8:** I'm Catholic and I struggled with this. But my daughter is 16. I don't want her future controlled by politicians.

**P3:** Up north, this is actually contentious. Some of my friends are very pro-life. But even some of them think the bans go too far.

**P7:** I have two daughters. This is personal. I can't support a party that wants to control their healthcare.

**P2:** I'm pro-life. I won't pretend otherwise. But the 1931 law in Michigan - no exceptions for rape? That's extreme even for me.

**P6:** I'm old fashioned on this but I also believe in freedom. It's a tough issue.

**P4:** My wife is the one who changed my mind. She asked me how I'd feel if our daughter needed care and couldn't get it. That stuck with me.

**P10:** In Holland, this is tearing apart some churches. People who've been Republican forever are questioning everything.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you a statement: "Sarah Holloway will protect your freedom to make your own healthcare decisions, including reproductive care. Politicians don't belong in the exam room - those choices should be between a woman and her doctor."

**P1:** Perfect. This is exactly the message. 5 out of 5.

**P5:** Yes. Freedom framing is right. 5 out of 5.

**P9:** "Freedom" is the key word. That's a value I hold. 4 out of 5.

**P7:** I would vote for this. 5 out of 5.

**P4:** "Politicians don't belong in the exam room" - that's it. 5 out of 5.

**P3:** This works for moderates. 4 out of 5.

**P8:** I'm conflicted but this message respects that. 4 out of 5.

**P6:** I can live with this framing. 3 out of 5.

**P2:** I disagree on the issue but I respect the framing. 2 out of 5.

**P10:** This is how you reach people who are uncomfortable with extremes on either side. 4 out of 5.

**Average: 4.1/5**

### Crime and Public Safety (68:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Governor Vanderberg has been running ads saying Holloway is "soft on crime." How do you respond to that?

**P6:** Crime is a real issue. I was a cop for 25 years. But "soft on crime" is a political slogan, not an analysis of her record.

**P8:** She prosecuted people for what happened in Flint. That doesn't sound soft to me.

**P4:** These attacks feel like the same playbook every Republican uses against every Democrat. It's lazy.

**P3:** I'd want to see actual evidence. What cases? What policies? Don't just tell me she's soft.

**P9:** Midland doesn't have a huge crime problem but I understand it's real in bigger cities.

**P2:** Rural areas don't have the same crime issues. It's different out here.

**P1:** She was AG. She prosecuted criminals. This attack seems dishonest.

**P7:** I'm more worried about economic crime - companies ripping off consumers - than street crime. She went after that.

**P5:** The "soft on crime" thing is a dog whistle. It's about scaring people, not solving problems.

**P10:** I want safety but I also want fairness. Slogans don't help.

**MODERATOR:** What would an effective public safety message from Holloway look like?

**P6:** Don't be defensive. Talk about what you'd do proactively. Hire more cops. Fund training. Support mental health services.

**P8:** Accountability. Like she did with Flint. Hold bad actors accountable whether they're criminals or corporations or politicians.

**P4:** Talk about the root causes - economic opportunity, education, mental health. Crime doesn't happen in a vacuum.

**P3:** Acknowledge that people feel unsafe. Don't dismiss it as perception. Then offer solutions.

### Infrastructure and Flint/Flooding Discussion (78:00 - 88:00)

**MODERATOR:** We've heard from P8 about Flint and P9 about the flooding. How important is infrastructure to you?

**P8:** It's life and death. My kid has lead in his blood because the government failed us. When politicians talk about infrastructure, I need to know they mean it.

**P9:** We lost everything in the flood. The dams failed because nobody invested in maintaining them. That's infrastructure. That's life or death.

**P2:** Roads in rural Michigan are terrible. I drive a tractor on some of them and I worry about my equipment getting damaged. Bridges are weight-restricted because they're falling apart.

**P4:** The auto industry needs good infrastructure - roads, ports, broadband. You can't have a modern economy with crumbling bridges.

**P3:** Up north, internet is still terrible in a lot of places. Kids trying to do remote learning couldn't because the infrastructure wasn't there.

**P6:** Saginaw needs investment. The roads, the water systems, the public facilities. It feels abandoned.

**P7:** My bakery lost power three times last winter. The grid is unreliable. That's infrastructure too.

**MODERATOR:** Statement: "I'll make infrastructure a top priority - fixing roads and bridges, ensuring clean water for every community, upgrading our electric grid, and expanding broadband so no Michigan family is left behind. We'll never have another Flint or another Midland."

**P8:** "Never another Flint." If she means it, I'm there. 5 out of 5.

**P9:** Same for flooding. 5 out of 5.

**P2:** Good rural message - roads, bridges, broadband. 4 out of 5.

**P4:** Comprehensive. 4 out of 5.

**P6:** Saginaw needs this. 4 out of 5.

**P3:** Broadband is huge for the north. 4 out of 5.

**P7:** Grid reliability matters for small business. 4 out of 5.

**P1:** This shows she's thinking about the whole state. 4 out of 5.

**P5:** Climate-forward infrastructure. 4 out of 5.

**P10:** Solid commitment. 4 out of 5.

**Average: 4.2/5**

---

### Closing: Vote Intent and Persuasion Points (88:00 - 95:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final round. Where are you leaning and what would seal the deal?

**P1:** Holloway. Abortion and healthcare locked me in. The AG record confirmed it.

**P2:** Still undecided but more open to Holloway than I expected. If she can talk rural economy credibly, I could vote for her. Never thought I'd say that.

**P3:** Leaning Holloway. Specific economic plans plus infrastructure. Tourism economy needs investment.

**P4:** Holloway. Auto worker, UAW. She seems to understand our community. The GM dad helps.

**P5:** Definitely Holloway. Reproductive rights, climate, forward-looking vision.

**P6:** Tough one. I'm a law-and-order guy. But I'm also not comfortable with where the Republicans are going. Genuinely torn.

**P7:** Holloway. Small business needs someone who understands regular people. Her background resonates.

**P8:** Holloway. The Flint thing matters more than anything else. She showed up when nobody else did.

**P9:** Leaning Holloway now, after the abortion stuff and the infrastructure message. Surprised myself.

**P10:** Holloway. Time for a change. Vanderberg has been mediocre and the party has gotten extreme.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time and candor.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Geographic diversity reveals shared economic anxiety** - From rural Lenawee to urban Flint to tourist Traverse City, cost of living dominates. The squeeze is universal even if the specifics differ.

2. **Specificity dramatically improves message reception** - Generic "fight for working families" scored 3.5/5. Add specific numbers ($200, $35) and it jumps to 4.0/5. This pattern held throughout.

3. **Negative attacks universally rejected** - Statement E (pure attack) scored 2.0/5. Even voters open to the critique wanted affirmative vision. Attack fatigue is real.

4. **AG record is the strongest asset** - Statement F (AG accomplishments) scored highest at 4.1/5. Flint especially resonates beyond just Flint voters as proof she delivers.

5. **Abortion freedom framing works broadly** - Even P6 (retired cop, traditional) could "live with" the freedom framing. P9 (lifelong Republican) is reconsidering her vote. This is a realignment issue.

6. **Infrastructure is visceral in affected communities** - P8 and P9 represent communities traumatized by infrastructure failure. "Never another Flint or Midland" is powerful.

7. **Rural Michigan is reachable** - P2 (farmer, Republican) expressed openness. Rural-specific messaging (broadband, roads, farm economy) could move voters typically written off.

### Highest Scoring Messages

1. Infrastructure commitment: 4.2/5
2. AG record with Flint: 4.1/5
3. Abortion freedom: 4.1/5
4. Specific economic policies ($35 insulin, gas tax): 4.0/5
5. Biography: 3.8/5

### Lowest Scoring Messages

1. Economic triumphalism: 1.7/5
2. Pure negative attack: 2.0/5

### Surprising Moments

- **P2 (farmer, Republican) open to Holloway** - "Never thought I'd say that." Rural outreach could work.

- **P9 (lifelong Republican, Midland) moving on abortion** - Infrastructure AND abortion creating double persuasion effect.

- **P8's emotional response to Flint mention** - AG record is deeply meaningful to affected communities. Authenticity breakthrough.

- **Negative attacks utterly rejected** - Even voters who had criticisms of Vanderberg wanted positive vision, not attacks.

### Regional Patterns

- **Southeast (Macomb, Oakland, Ann Arbor):** Economic + abortion dual priority
- **Mid-Michigan (Saginaw, Midland, Flint):** Infrastructure + trust issues, recovery-focused
- **West (Holland, Kalamazoo):** Traditional values in flux, abortion shifting alignments
- **North (Traverse City):** Tourism economy fragile, housing crisis acute
- **Rural (Lenawee):** Farm economy stressed, infrastructure needs, reachable

### Recommended Actions

1. **Lead with specific economic policies** - Numbers beat slogans every time with this audience.

2. **Integrate AG record throughout** - Don't just mention Flint once. Use it as proof point for every promise.

3. **Infrastructure message can reach rural and urban** - Unifying theme across geographies.

4. **Abortion as freedom** - Test message holds statewide including in conservative areas.

5. **Avoid pure negative messaging** - Contrast is fine but must include affirmative vision.

6. **Develop rural outreach** - Farm economy specifics, broadband, rural roads. Don't cede territory.
