## Discussion

### Opening: Life in Rural Northern Michigan (0:00 - 20:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thanks everyone for being here. I want to start by hearing about life up here in Northern Michigan. What's it like?

**P1:** You want the honest answer? It's like we don't exist. Politicians come up here during hunting season, put on an orange vest for a photo, and then forget about us for four years. Both parties do it.

**P4:** [Jumping in immediately] That's exactly right. Lansing doesn't care about us. Washington doesn't care about us. We're just—

**P1:** [Continuing] —flyover country. They fly over us to get to Traverse City or Mackinac Island.

**MODERATOR:** P4, let me come back to you in a moment. P6, what's your experience?

**P6:** I run the hardware store on main street. Been there 40 years, my father before me. Every year it gets harder. Walmart came in, Amazon takes more business. Young people leave because there's no jobs. The town is dying slowly.

**P7:** He's right. I work at the IGA - we're the only grocery store for 20 miles. People drive an hour to Walmart in Gaylord to save money. I don't blame them. We can't compete on price.

**P2:** I'm a nurse at the hospital here. We're the only hospital in the county. Every year there's talk about cutting services, maybe closing the ER overnight. If that happens, people will die. A heart attack at 2 AM - you can't drive an hour to Traverse City.

**P5:** The schools are struggling too. We've consolidated twice in 15 years. Kids are on the bus for an hour each way. Teachers don't want to move up here - we can't pay what downstate pays. How do you attract talent to a place with no housing, no restaurants, no... [trails off]

**P3:** I retired up here from Flint. Thought it'd be peaceful. It is peaceful. But I watch this area decline year after year. The young people all leave. Who can blame them?

**MODERATOR:** P4, you were saying something about government?

**P4:** Yeah. I run a logging operation and a hunting guide business. The regulations are killing us. DNR, EPA, all these agencies making rules from offices in Lansing. They've never set foot in these woods but they're telling me how to manage them.

**P8:** [Quietly] I work for DNR. Regulations exist for reasons.

**P4:** [Turning] No offense to you personally. But the bureaucracy is insane. The paperwork. The permits. It takes six months to get approval for things that used to take a phone call.

**P8:** I don't disagree that the process is slow. I'm just saying the regulations usually have a purpose - water quality, sustainable harvest, public safety.

**P4:** And I'm saying the people making these rules have no idea what life is like out here.

### Economic Realities: The Forgotten Economy (20:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about the economy. What are the main economic concerns up here?

**P1:** Where do I start? Fertilizer prices doubled. Diesel is through the roof. I'm paying $6 a gallon for farm diesel. Milk prices haven't gone up to match. I'm losing money on every gallon I produce.

**P6:** Same. Everything I stock costs more. My suppliers raised prices 30, 40 percent. I raise prices, customers go to Amazon. I eat the cost, I go out of business. There's no winning.

**P7:** [Voice cracking slightly] My husband got hurt at the factory 10 years ago. Disability doesn't go up with inflation. We're on a fixed income that buys less every month. I pick up shifts at the IGA just to pay for his medications.

**MODERATOR:** I'm sorry to hear that, P7.

**P7:** It's okay. I'm not looking for pity. I'm just saying - politicians talk about the economy like it's numbers on a screen. For us it's real. It's choosing between heating oil and groceries.

**P4:** Nobody's coming to save us. That's the thing. Government programs go to Detroit, to the cities. Out here we're on our own. Always have been.

**P3:** That's not entirely true. Social Security and Medicare are government programs. They're keeping a lot of people up here alive, including me.

**P4:** Fine, but those are things we paid into. I'm talking about all the new spending - trillions of dollars - and none of it comes here. Where's our infrastructure money? The roads up here are worse than downstate.

**P5:** Broadband. That's my issue. During COVID, my students couldn't do remote learning because half of them don't have internet. We're in 2022 and kids are driving to the McDonald's parking lot to use WiFi for homework.

**P2:** We can't do telemedicine because patients don't have reliable internet. It's a healthcare issue too.

**P6:** They promised broadband money for years. It never materializes. Or it goes to companies that take the money and don't build anything.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you blame for these economic challenges?

**P1:** [Laughs bitterly] How much time do you have? Both parties have failed us. Clinton signed NAFTA - killed manufacturing here. Obama didn't help. Trump made promises and didn't deliver. Biden's been a disaster with inflation.

**P4:** Democrats are worse. All they care about is—

**P3:** [Interrupting] Now hold on. I'm a union guy. Democrats have been better for workers historically. But I'll admit they've lost touch with places like this.

**P4:** Lost touch? They actively hate us. We're the "deplorables." The "bitter clingers." They think we're stupid racists because we hunt and go to church.

**P5:** That's not fair. I'm a Democrat and I live here.

**P4:** No offense to you. I'm talking about the party, the politicians, the coastal elites who run things.

**MODERATOR:** Let's hear from P8. You've been quiet.

**P8:** I try to stay out of politics in my job. But I will say - the people making decisions about natural resources don't always understand rural communities. There's a disconnect. Whether that's partisan or just urban-rural, I don't know.

### Candidate Perceptions (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about the Governor's race. What do you think of Governor Vanderberg?

**P6:** He's been okay for business, I guess. Tax climate is reasonable. But has he done anything specific for Northern Michigan? I can't name one thing.

**P1:** He came up here during the campaign four years ago. Made promises about agriculture, about rural broadband. Haven't seen him since. Haven't seen the broadband either.

**P4:** He's a West Michigan guy, Grand Rapids. That's as close to "rural" as Republicans get anymore. It's not this.

**P3:** At least he's not actively hostile. That's the bar now. Not actively hostile to people like us.

**P2:** I don't have strong feelings. He hasn't hurt the hospital but he hasn't helped either.

**MODERATOR:** What about Sarah Holloway, the Democratic challenger?

**P4:** [Immediately] No. Absolutely not. She's a—

**P1:** [Cutting in] Let me guess - she's from Oakland County, downstate, doesn't know us, doesn't care about us.

**P4:** Exactly. She's a suburban Detroit Democrat. What does she know about farming? About logging? About—

**MODERATOR:** [Firmly] P4, I appreciate your passion but I need to hear from everyone. P7, what's your impression of Holloway?

**P7:** I don't know much about her. I've seen ads. She talks about healthcare, which matters to me. But... [pauses] I don't know if she understands what it's like up here.

**P5:** I looked at her education platform. It's okay. Some good ideas about funding. But rural schools have different problems than Detroit or Ann Arbor. I'm not sure she gets that.

**P2:** The abortion issue matters to me. As a woman, as a healthcare provider. She's clearly better on that than Vanderberg. But is that enough? I don't know.

**P8:** I'd want to know her position on conservation, natural resources. Those issues matter a lot up here. Tourism, hunting, fishing - that's our economy too.

**P3:** I'm a union guy, like I said. Normally I'd vote Democrat automatically. But she doesn't feel like she's speaking to me. It's all suburban stuff, Detroit stuff. Where's the message for rural Michigan?

**P6:** Has she even been up here? Has either of them? That tells you everything.

### Message Testing (55:00 - 70:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you some statements and get your reaction.

**MODERATOR:** First: "Sarah Holloway will fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share."

**P1:** [Sighs] Here we go. "Corporate greed." Lady, there's no corporations up here. There's farmers and small businesses trying to survive. Who's she fighting for?

**P4:** "Wealthy pay their fair share" - that means higher taxes. Guess who ends up paying? Not the wealthy. They have accountants. It's people like us.

**P6:** I'm not wealthy. I own a hardware store. But under their definition I'm probably a "small business owner" who needs to pay more. No thanks.

**P7:** I don't disagree with the idea but it sounds like something they say in Detroit. What does it have to do with me?

**P3:** It's old. This message has been around since I was young. Nothing changes.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Responses:** P1: 1, P2: 2, P3: 2, P4: 1, P5: 2, P6: 1, P7: 2, P8: 3

**Average: 1.75/5**

**MODERATOR:** Second: "Sarah Holloway will invest in rural Michigan - expanding broadband to every community, keeping rural hospitals open, and ensuring family farms can compete."

**P1:** [Pauses] Okay, that's... that's better. Those are actual things that affect me.

**P5:** Broadband. Yes. If she actually did that, it would matter.

**P2:** Rural hospitals - that's life and death for us. If she means it, I'm interested.

**P6:** "Invest" usually means spending. How's she paying for it?

**P4:** I've heard these promises before. They never happen. The money goes to consultants and contractors downstate.

**P7:** Family farms - that's P1. That matters.

**P3:** This is the right message. Whether I believe she'll do it is another question.

**P8:** Better. Actually addresses our issues.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Responses:** P1: 3, P2: 4, P3: 3, P4: 2, P5: 4, P6: 3, P7: 3, P8: 4

**Average: 3.25/5** - Significant improvement

**MODERATOR:** Third: "As Attorney General, Sarah Holloway prosecuted the criminals who poisoned Flint's water. She'll bring that same fight to make sure every Michigan community has clean water and safe infrastructure."

**P3:** I'm from Flint originally. What they did to Flint was criminal. She actually held people accountable?

**MODERATOR:** Yes, she led the prosecution.

**P3:** [Nodding] That means something. Government accountability. That's rare.

**P1:** Clean water matters. Farm runoff is an issue - I know that. If she's serious about infrastructure...

**P2:** Infrastructure is healthcare too. Water systems, roads to hospitals, all of it.

**P4:** Okay, I'll give her credit for Flint. That was wrong what happened there. But one thing doesn't make me trust her.

**P5:** This is effective. Concrete accomplishment, not just promises.

**MODERATOR:** Scale of 1-5?

**Average: 3.5/5** - Highest so far

### Abortion and Social Issues (70:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. How does that affect your vote?

**P4:** I'm pro-life. Always have been. This is a good thing.

**P2:** I'm a nurse. These laws are going to kill women. I've seen what happens when there are complications and doctors are afraid to act. This is dangerous.

**P7:** I'm old-fashioned. I don't like abortion. But I also don't like the government making medical decisions. It's complicated.

**P1:** I'm Catholic. But my daughter is 25 and I worry about her. What if something goes wrong with a pregnancy? These absolute bans scare me.

**P5:** In our community this is divisive. Half my teachers are upset, half think it's right. I try not to discuss it at school.

**P3:** My wife is furious about it. She's more motivated to vote than ever.

**P8:** I stay out of social issues. But I understand why people feel strongly.

**P4:** Can I say something? [Looks around] I know I'm the most conservative person here. But even I think some of these laws are too strict. No exceptions for rape? For when the mother's life is at risk? That's too far.

**P2:** [Surprised] I appreciate you saying that.

**P4:** I'm pro-life but I'm not heartless. There are situations where it's not black and white.

**MODERATOR:** Does abortion change how you'll vote in this race?

**P2:** Yes. It pushes me toward Holloway despite my other concerns.

**P4:** No. I'm still not voting for a Democrat. There are other issues.

**P1:** It complicates things. I'm leaning Vanderberg on the economy but my daughter is very upset with Republicans right now.

**P7:** It matters but it's not my top issue. The economy affects me every day.

---

### Closing: The Rural-Urban Divide (80:00 - 92:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final topic. Do you feel like either party understands rural Michigan?

**P1:** [Long pause] No. I don't. Democrats write us off as lost cause Trump voters. Republicans take us for granted because where else are we gonna go? Nobody's actually working for us.

**P6:** When's the last time anyone in Lansing spent real time up here? Not a campaign stop - real time. Understanding what we need?

**P4:** We're votes to be counted, not people to be helped.

**P5:** There's this assumption that rural people are all the same. We're not. We have teachers, nurses, business owners, farmers. We have Democrats and Republicans and independents. But nobody sees us as individuals.

**P3:** I'll say this - I think the divide is getting worse. Used to be you could disagree on politics but still be neighbors. Now everything is so tribal.

**P2:** I just want someone to show up. Campaign here. Listen to us. Make promises and actually keep them. Is that too much to ask?

**P7:** [Quietly] We're invisible. That's how it feels. Like we're invisible.

**P8:** I'll add - there's a lot of resentment built up. Years of being ignored. That doesn't go away with one campaign or one election. It'll take real, sustained attention.

**MODERATOR:** How are you likely to vote in November?

**P1:** Probably Vanderberg. Not because I love him - just because I trust Democrats less.

**P2:** Undecided. Abortion pulls me to Holloway. Everything else pulls me away.

**P3:** Probably Holloway. Union guy. But I'm not happy about it.

**P4:** Vanderberg. Not even close.

**P5:** Genuinely torn. Might come down to who shows up and actually makes an effort.

**P6:** Vanderberg. Better for small business. Marginally.

**P7:** I don't know yet. [Pause] I really don't know.

**P8:** Keeping that to myself.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your honesty tonight.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Profound sense of abandonment** - "We're invisible," "nobody cares about us," "flyover country." This isn't partisan - it's directed at both parties.

2. **Generic Democratic messaging fails completely** - "Corporate greed" scored 1.75/5. They literally laughed at it. "There's no corporations up here."

3. **Rural-specific messaging works dramatically better** - Broadband, rural hospitals, family farms scored 3.25/5. A 1.5-point jump just from speaking to their actual concerns.

4. **Flint/accountability message resonates** - Even in Trump country, holding government accountable for Flint landed (3.5/5). Proof over promises.

5. **Economic anxiety is crushing but different than suburban** - It's not just "prices going up." It's farm input costs, hospital closures, brain drain, dying towns. Different texture.

6. **Cultural alienation is real and deep** - "Deplorables," "bitter clingers" - they remember these insults. There's resentment from feeling looked down upon.

7. **Abortion is complicated here too** - Even P4 (most conservative) acknowledged absolute bans go too far. It's not uniform opposition.

### Moderator Self-Note: Managing P4

P4 dominated early portions of the discussion and needed to be redirected several times. His views are important data but were crowding out other voices. I made deliberate effort to draw out quieter participants (P7, P8) after the first section.

### Vote Intent

- **Likely Vanderberg:** P1, P4, P6 (3)
- **Likely Holloway:** P3 (1)
- **Genuinely Undecided:** P2, P5, P7 (3)
- **Would not share:** P8 (1)

This is a 3-1-3-1 room in strong Republican territory. The undecideds are notable - these could be reached with right message.

### What Would Move Rural Voters

1. **Physical presence** - Campaign here. Not photo ops - real town halls, real listening.

2. **Rural-specific policy** - Broadband, rural healthcare, farm policy. Not "working families" generic.

3. **Accountability proof** - Flint prosecution was credible. More concrete accomplishments, less promises.

4. **Respect** - Stop treating rural voters as lost cause or cultural enemy. They know when they're being condescended to.

5. **Follow-through** - Broken promises have accumulated for decades. Any new promise starts in a trust deficit.

### Why Democrats Are Losing Here

1. Economic messaging doesn't translate ("corporate greed" = laughed at)
2. Cultural messaging feels hostile ("they think we're stupid racists")
3. No visible presence or investment
4. Generic "working families" ignores rural-specific issues
5. Trust has been broken by decades of ignored promises

### Verbatim Quotes for Strategy
