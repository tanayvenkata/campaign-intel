## Discussion

### Opening: General Political Environment (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Good evening everyone, and thank you for being here. I want to start by just getting a sense of how you're all feeling about things in Michigan right now. What's on your mind when you think about the direction of the state? Anyone can jump in.

**P1:** Honestly? I'm exhausted. [Several nods around the room] Everything is so divisive. I own a small business and I just want someone who's going to focus on the basics - keep the roads fixed, keep the schools decent, and maybe not make everything into a fight.

**P8:** That's exactly it. The exhaustion is real. I feel like we've been in crisis mode for... what, six years now? Seven? I just want things to feel normal again.

**P2:** For me it's the economy that keeps me up at night. I'm doing okay at the plant - we're actually hiring right now, which is good - but I see prices going up everywhere. Gas was killing me this summer. Groceries are through the roof. My wife does the shopping and she comes home stressed every time.

**P4:** The inflation is real. I'm retired, fixed income, and I've had to adjust our budget significantly. We're not hurting, but I know people who are.

**MODERATOR:** When you say prices are going up, what specifically are you noticing?

**P2:** Gas, obviously. It was over five dollars a gallon in June. That's insane. And groceries - a box of cereal is like six bucks now. Milk. Eggs went crazy for a while.

**P9:** I run my own business, electrical work, and my material costs are up probably 30 percent from two years ago. Wire, panels, everything. I have to pass that on to customers and I hate it. Some people look at me like I'm trying to rip them off.

**P5:** For me it's rent. I'm a nurse, I make decent money, but trying to find an apartment in Royal Oak that doesn't cost half my paycheck is impossible. I have student loans on top of that. I'm 34 and I feel like I'm never going to be able to buy a house.

**P7:** The housing market here is crazy. I'm in real estate and I've never seen anything like it. Houses going 50, 60 thousand over asking. Cash offers. Regular families can't compete.

**P3:** And then you add what's happening in the schools... [sighs] I'm a teacher and we're dealing with so much right now. Kids are struggling after COVID - the learning loss is real, the behavior issues, the mental health stuff. We don't have enough staff. And then on top of that there's all this political fighting about what we can teach, what books can be in the library. It's demoralizing.

**MODERATOR:** Tell me more about that, P3. The political fighting around schools.

**P3:** It's like... parents are showing up to school board meetings screaming about critical race theory, which we don't even teach. We're just trying to help kids learn to read. There's this whole movement that seems to think teachers are the enemy. I've been teaching for twenty years and I've never felt less respected.

**P6:** I have kids in the schools and I feel caught in the middle on this stuff. I don't think teachers are the enemy - my kids have had great teachers. But I also think some of the curriculum stuff has gotten a little... I don't know, ideological? I'm not saying critical race theory, that's overblown. But there's a vibe sometimes.

**P3:** What do you mean by ideological?

**P6:** Just... like there's a certain way you're supposed to think about things. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want my kids to learn math and reading and how to think for themselves.

**P8:** Can we talk about something else that's on my mind? [Looks around] The abortion thing. Ever since that Supreme Court decision, I can't stop thinking about it.

**P10:** Me too. I'm 63 years old. I remember what it was like before Roe. My sister... [pauses] she had a really scary situation in the early 70s. I never thought we'd be going backwards.

**P7:** It's terrifying. I have a daughter in college. What if something happens to her? Michigan's old law is still on the books, right?

**P5:** The 1931 law, yeah. It would make abortion a felony. I work in healthcare and we're already seeing the effects - doctors are afraid, patients are confused. It's chaos.

**P4:** I'm pro-life personally, but I'll be honest, some of these laws are going too far. No exceptions for rape? That's extreme. I don't think that represents most people.

**P9:** I'm Catholic, so I struggle with this. But my wife made a good point - she said the government shouldn't be making these decisions for women. That stuck with me.

---

### Candidate Impressions: Incumbent Governor Rick Vanderberg (15:00 - 32:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about the candidates. Governor Vanderberg has been in office for four years now. When you think about him, what comes to mind?

**P4:** He's been... fine, I guess. Not amazing but not terrible. I voted for him four years ago. I don't regret it exactly, but I'm not excited about him either.

**P1:** He handled COVID weird. Remember the protests at the Capitol? With the guns? That was insane. And he kind of... played to those people, I felt.

**P2:** He's a West Michigan guy, right? Grand Rapids? I feel like he doesn't really understand this side of the state. The auto industry, the union stuff. He's more of a business Republican.

**P7:** I think he's out of touch. He talks about the economy like everything's fine. Things are not fine for a lot of people.

**P6:** To be fair, the economy did recover pretty well from COVID. Unemployment is low. But yeah, the inflation thing... he doesn't seem to have an answer for that.

**MODERATOR:** What about his personality, his style?

**P8:** He's kind of bland? Like a generic politician. I couldn't tell you one memorable thing he's said.

**P9:** He seems like a decent guy. I don't think he's corrupt or anything. But I don't know what he stands for other than lower taxes and business stuff.

**P10:** I'm worried about what he'd do on abortion. He's been vague about it, which makes me nervous. Republicans in the legislature want that old law enforced.

**P5:** The way he talked about healthcare workers during COVID bothered me. He was praising us one minute and then pushing back on any safety requirements the next. Pick a lane.

**P3:** His education stuff has not been good. DeVos-style charter school stuff. More money for private schools, less for public. I take that personally.

**MODERATOR:** If you had to give Governor Vanderberg a grade for his four years, what would it be?

**P4:** C plus.

**P1:** C.

**P2:** C minus.

**P7:** D plus. Sorry, I just don't think he's done much.

**P6:** B minus. I think people are being a little hard on him. COVID was tough for every governor.

**P8:** C.

**P9:** C plus.

**P10:** C minus. The abortion thing matters to me.

**P5:** D. Healthcare was a mess.

**P3:** D. Education.

### Candidate Impressions: Challenger Sarah Holloway (32:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** Now let's talk about Sarah Holloway, the Democratic candidate. What have you heard about her? What's your impression?

**P1:** I don't know much about her honestly. She was the Attorney General, right? Did something with the Flint water thing?

**P5:** Yeah, she prosecuted some of the officials responsible for Flint. I remember that. It seemed like she actually cared about it.

**P2:** I've seen some of her ads. She seems okay. Talks about working families and stuff. But I don't know enough yet.

**P7:** She seems smart. I saw her in an interview and she was articulate. Didn't dodge questions the way politicians usually do.

**P4:** I don't know anything about her positions. What's her plan for the economy? That's what I want to know.

**MODERATOR:** For those of you who don't know much about her - what would you want to learn?

**P4:** Like I said, economy. What's she going to do about inflation? About gas prices? Those are state issues too, not just federal.

**P9:** Same. I want to know if she's going to raise my taxes. I own a small business. Every time Democrats talk about "making the rich pay their fair share" I end up getting squeezed even though I'm not rich.

**P6:** I'd want to know where she stands on the culture war stuff. Is she one of those progressive Democrats who's going to make everything about identity politics? Or is she more of a pragmatic moderate?

**P3:** I care about education. What's she going to do for public schools? For teachers?

**P10:** Abortion. I need to know she's going to protect our rights. That's my number one issue now.

**P8:** I want to know if she can actually get things done. It's one thing to have good ideas, another to work with the legislature. Michigan has been so gridlocked.

**MODERATOR:** Has anyone seen her ads or heard her speak?

**P7:** I saw an ad about her growing up in Oakland County. Went to public schools here. Her dad was a teacher I think? Or worked for GM?

**P2:** GM. The ad said he worked on the line at GM for thirty years. That's good - she gets where we come from.

**P5:** There was an ad about the Flint prosecution. Showed her actually in Flint, talking to families. It felt real, not staged.

**P1:** I haven't seen that one. Most of the ads I've seen are attacks. Both sides attacking each other. It's a turnoff.

**MODERATOR:** What's your impression of her as a person, from what little you know?

**P7:** She seems competent. Professional. Not a bomb-thrower.

**P4:** She's a Democrat, so I'm skeptical. But she doesn't seem like a socialist or anything crazy.

**P2:** She seems like someone who might actually understand regular people. The AG job... she went after bad guys, right? That's something.

**P10:** I just hope she's solid on protecting women's rights. That's what matters to me.

---

### Issue Deep Dive: Economy and Cost of Living (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's spend some time on the economy since that keeps coming up. When politicians talk about "the economy," what does that actually mean to you in your daily life?

**P2:** Whether I can pay my bills. Whether my job is secure. Whether I'm falling behind or getting ahead. That's the economy to me.

**P9:** It's the cost of everything. Running my business, I see it every day. Insurance costs, material costs, gas for the truck. It all adds up.

**P5:** For me it's student loans and rent eating up my paycheck before I can save anything. I feel like I'm running in place.

**P1:** Small business owner here - it's whether my customers have money to spend on non-essentials. When things are tight, my gift shop is the first thing people cut. I can feel it when the economy is bad.

**P7:** In real estate we say "it's the interest rates, stupid." Right now rates are making it impossible for buyers. The economy feels stuck.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you blame for the current economic situation? If anyone?

**P4:** It's complicated. COVID messed everything up. Supply chains. Then the government printed a ton of money and now we have inflation. Both parties did that.

**P2:** I blame the corporations honestly. They're posting record profits while telling us they have to raise prices. That's bull.

**P6:** It's global. Gas prices are high because of Ukraine. Some of it Biden, sure, but a lot of it nobody can control.

**P9:** I don't think any politician can really fix it. They all promise stuff they can't deliver. I just want them to not make it worse.

**P8:** The federal government matters more on this stuff than the state, right? What can a governor really do about inflation?

**MODERATOR:** That's a good question. Do you think the Governor can affect your economic situation?

**P4:** Somewhat. State taxes, regulations, that kind of thing. But yeah, most of it is federal.

**P2:** Roads matter. If I'm stuck in traffic burning gas, that costs me money. Fix the damn roads.

**P3:** School funding is state. If my property taxes go up to pay for schools because the state cuts funding, that affects me.

**P7:** Business climate matters. If companies want to move here, that creates jobs. Governor can affect that.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you two approaches to the economy and get your reaction.

**MODERATOR:** First approach: "We need to cut taxes and regulations to let businesses grow and create jobs. Government needs to get out of the way."

**P4:** That's classic Republican stuff. I'm generally sympathetic but it feels incomplete. What about people who need help?

**P9:** I like lower taxes. But what about the roads? You need money for that.

**P6:** It's too simple. Some regulations are good - you don't want companies polluting everything.

**MODERATOR:** Second approach: "We need to invest in working families - cut the cost of childcare, lower prescription drug prices, make the wealthy pay their fair share."

**P5:** That resonates with me more. Childcare costs are insane. Prescription drugs too.

**P2:** I like the idea but I've heard this before. "Make the wealthy pay their fair share" - and then my taxes go up anyway. Show me specifically how.

**P7:** What does "invest" mean? More government spending? That's what caused inflation in the first place.

**P10:** I'm on Medicare so prescription drugs matter to me. If she can actually do something about that, I'm interested.

**P1:** Both of these feel like slogans. I want specifics. What exactly are you going to do?

---

### Message Testing (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** I'm going to read you some statements that a candidate might make, and I want your honest reaction. Don't worry about being polite - just tell me what you actually think when you hear this.

**MODERATOR:** First statement: "Sarah Holloway will fight for working families by lowering costs and protecting good-paying jobs."

**P2:** That's fine but everyone says that. What does it actually mean? How is she going to lower my grocery bill?

**P4:** Generic. Could be any Democrat.

**P8:** "Fight for" is such political language. Just tell me what you'll do.

**P1:** I don't disagree with it, but it doesn't make me excited either.

**P5:** It's okay. I'd need to hear more.

**MODERATOR:** Second statement: "As Attorney General, Sarah Holloway took on powerful interests to protect Michigan families - from prosecuting the officials who poisoned Flint's water to going after companies that ripped off consumers. As Governor, she'll bring that same fight to lower costs for working people."

**P7:** That's better. It's specific. The Flint thing gives her credibility.

**P2:** I like that she has a track record. She actually did something, not just talked about it.

**P10:** Much better than the first one. Shows she's willing to take on powerful people.

**P4:** Still pretty vague on what she'd actually do as Governor, but the AG record is a plus.

**P1:** "Ripped off consumers" - I want to know more about that. What companies? What did she do?

**MODERATOR:** Third statement: "Sarah Holloway will protect your freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. She'll fight to make sure Michigan women - not politicians - have the right to choose."

**P10:** [Emotional] Yes. This is what I need to hear. This is my issue.

**P5:** As a healthcare worker, this matters a lot. Politicians should not be practicing medicine.

**P7:** Powerful. And timely with everything happening.

**P8:** I'm pro-choice and this is important, but I hope it's not the only thing she talks about. Some people might tune out.

**P4:** I'm pro-life, so this doesn't move me. But I understand why it matters to others.

**P9:** I'm conflicted on abortion, but "freedom to make your own decisions" frames it in a way I can get behind. I don't want the government telling my wife what to do.

**P6:** This is smart messaging. Even people who are uncomfortable with abortion don't want government overreach.

**MODERATOR:** Fourth statement: "Sarah Holloway grew up right here in Oakland County. Her father worked at GM for thirty years. She went to public schools and put herself through college. She knows what it takes to build a good life in Michigan because she's lived it."

**P2:** I like that. She's not some out-of-touch rich person. She comes from where we come from.

**P7:** The Oakland County thing helps. She's local.

**P1:** Her dad at GM is good. Shows she understands manufacturing, working families.

**P4:** Biography is nice but I care more about policy. What's she going to do?

**P3:** Public schools is good. Means she might actually support them.

**MODERATOR:** Fifth statement: "Sarah Holloway will cap the cost of insulin at 35 dollars a month, cut the gas tax to give families immediate relief, and make sure the wealthy pay their fair share so working people get a break."

**P10:** Now we're talking. Specific numbers. Insulin cap is huge.

**P2:** Cut the gas tax - that would help right now. Not some abstract promise, actual relief.

**P9:** What's the plan for "wealthy pay their fair share"? I need to know I'm not getting squeezed.

**P4:** These are specific, which is good. But how does she pay for it? I don't trust politicians who promise everything.

**P5:** Insulin cap matters. I see patients who can't afford their medication. It's heartbreaking.

**P8:** This is much better than the generic stuff. Give me specifics, tell me how it affects my life.

**P6:** The gas tax cut is interesting. That's immediate, tangible. People would notice.

---

### Attack Ad Response (78:00 - 88:00)

**MODERATOR:** Now I'm going to show you an ad that Governor Vanderberg's campaign has been running. Watch it and then we'll discuss.

[Ad plays: 30-second spot with dark imagery of urban crime scenes, headlines about carjackings, narrator says "Sarah Holloway's soft-on-crime policies made Michigan less safe. As Attorney General, she let dangerous criminals walk free. Now she wants to be Governor? Michigan families can't afford the risk. Rick Vanderberg: tough on crime, protecting Michigan families."]

**P1:** That's a bit much. Like, I have concerns about crime but that felt over the top. Scary music, dark images... it's manipulative.

**P3:** I hate these kinds of ads. Just trying to scare people instead of telling me what Vanderberg is going to do.

**P6:** I mean, crime is a real issue. Carjackings in Detroit have been insane. I don't think it's unfair to ask where she stands on public safety.

**P2:** But is it true? Did she actually let dangerous criminals go free? That sounds like BS.

**P7:** It's so negative. This is why people hate politics.

**P9:** I'll be honest, it makes me want to know more. I don't like being scared, but safety matters. What's her record actually?

**P4:** Attorney General doesn't really set crime policy though, right? She prosecutes cases. This seems misleading.

**P5:** This is fear-mongering. Detroit has problems but it's not a war zone like this ad makes it seem.

**P10:** I'm more worried about women losing their rights than crime. This ad doesn't change my priorities.

**P8:** It's effective, unfortunately. Even if it's exaggerated, it plants doubt. That's what these ads do.

**MODERATOR:** Does an ad like this make you more or less likely to vote for Vanderberg?

**P1:** Less. I don't like being manipulated.

**P6:** Maybe slightly more likely to look into the crime issue. Not necessarily vote for him, but I want to understand it better.

**P3:** Way less. This is gross.

**P2:** Less. If this is all he's got, attacking her, he doesn't have a positive message.

**P7:** Much less. Negative ads turn me off.

**P9:** Neutral. I don't like the ad but I'm still interested in the substance.

**P4:** Slightly less. I prefer positive campaigns.

**P5:** Less. This is fear-mongering garbage.

**P10:** Much less. Attack ads are a turnoff.

**P8:** Probably neutral. I don't like it but I'm also not surprised.

---

### Closing: Vote Intent and Persuadability (88:00 - 95:00)

**MODERATOR:** Last section. If the election were held today, how would you vote? And what would it take to change your mind?

**P1:** I'm genuinely undecided. Probably lean slightly toward Holloway after tonight, but I could be convinced either way. I need to hear more about her economic plans.

**P2:** Leaning Holloway. The working-class background, the GM dad, that means something to me. But I'm not locked in.

**P3:** Holloway. Education and abortion are my issues and she's better on both. Can't see myself voting for Vanderberg.

**P4:** Still undecided but more open to Holloway than I expected. I'm a Republican but I'm not happy with where the party is going. Need to learn more about her fiscal policies.

**P5:** Holloway. Healthcare and abortion are huge for me. Vanderberg hasn't earned my vote.

**P6:** Truly undecided. I want a moderate. If Holloway comes across as too progressive, I might stick with Vanderberg even though he's uninspiring.

**P7:** Leaning Holloway strongly. The abortion issue pushed me over the edge. I'm a lifelong Republican who can't vote for that party anymore.

**P8:** Leaning Holloway but not committed. I want to see her debate him. See how she handles pressure.

**P9:** Undecided. Leaning Holloway but I'm worried about taxes. Need more information.

**P10:** Holloway, definitely. Abortion is my issue and I won't vote for anyone who threatens women's rights.

**MODERATOR:** What would each candidate need to do to win your vote?

**P1:** Holloway needs to be specific about the economy. Vanderberg needs to show me he's not just going to be a rubber stamp for the extreme parts of his party.

**P4:** Holloway needs to convince me she won't raise my taxes significantly. Vanderberg needs to distance himself from Trump and the crazies.

**P6:** Holloway needs to not be a far-left progressive. Vanderberg needs to show me he actually cares about people, not just business.

**P9:** Same as P1. Economy, specifics. And don't come after small business owners.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Economic anxiety is pervasive** - Cost of living (gas, groceries, housing) dominated opening discussion. Participants feel squeezed even if employed. This cuts across all demographics in the room.

2. **Abortion is a galvanizing issue post-Dobbs** - Multiple participants (P7, P10 especially) identified this as their top or deciding issue. Even conflicted participants (P9) responded to "freedom" framing. This is an asset for Holloway.

3. **Political exhaustion is real** - "Exhausted," "tired," wanting "normal" came up repeatedly. Negative campaigning is a turnoff for most. Participants want solutions, not fights.

4. **Vanderberg is vulnerable but not hated** - He's seen as mediocre (average grade: C/C+), bland, and out of touch. Not corrupt or terrible, just uninspiring. Low enthusiasm is a problem for him.

5. **Holloway has low name ID but no strong negatives** - Most participants knew little about her. Her AG record (especially Flint) is an asset when communicated. Working-class background resonates.

6. **Specificity matters enormously** - Generic messages ("fight for working families") fell flat. Specific policies ($35 insulin cap, gas tax cut) generated positive response. Participants are skeptical of slogans.

7. **Crime is a vulnerability but attack ad backfired** - Participants care about safety but found the attack ad manipulative and over-the-top. Several said it made them less likely to vote for Vanderberg. However, some wanted more information about Holloway's record.

### Surprising Moments

- **P7 (lifelong Republican) said she can't vote Republican anymore** - Abortion flipped her. This may represent a significant suburban shift.

- **P9 (Catholic, conflicted on abortion) responded to "freedom" framing** - "I don't want the government telling my wife what to do." Potential message for reaching conflicted voters.

- **P2 (union member) expressed skepticism of union endorsements** - "They tell us who to vote for but I make my own decisions." Union households need to be earned, not assumed.

- **Education came up with strong emotion** - P3's testimony about teacher demoralization was powerful. Other participants expressed solidarity even while having curriculum concerns.

- **The specific policy message was a clear winner** - $35 insulin, gas tax cut generated the most positive response of any message tested.

### Participant Movement

- **Moved toward Holloway:** P1, P4, P7, P8
- **Confirmed Holloway:** P3, P5, P10
- **Remained undecided:** P6, P9
- **Starting position Vanderberg, stayed there:** None

### Recommended Follow-up

1. **Develop specific economic messaging** - The insulin cap and gas tax cut worked. Find more policies with tangible, immediate impact that can be communicated simply.

2. **Abortion messaging should emphasize freedom, not just rights** - "Freedom to make your own decisions" reached even conflicted voters. This framing works better than clinical "reproductive rights" language.

3. **Build out the biography** - The GM dad, Oakland County, public schools story resonates. It humanizes her and establishes working-class credentials.

4. **Prepare crime response** - Even though the attack ad backfired, crime is a real concern. Holloway needs a proactive public safety message before opponents define her.

5. **Test "return to normal" framing** - The exhaustion is palpable. A message about competent, drama-free governance might resonate strongly.

6. **Don't over-rely on abortion** - It's an asset, but participants like P8 warned about it being "the only thing she talks about." Balance is needed.

### Demographic Notes

- **Women were more moved by abortion issue** than men, but men were not dismissive
- **Younger participants (P2, P5, P6)** most focused on economic concerns and feeling "stuck"
- **Older participants (P4, P10)** more concerned about where country/party is headed
- **Suburban professionals** want moderate, competent governance - allergic to extremes on either side
