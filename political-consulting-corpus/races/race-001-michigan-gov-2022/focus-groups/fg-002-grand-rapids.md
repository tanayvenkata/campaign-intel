## Discussion

### Opening: Economic Conditions in West Michigan (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thanks for joining us tonight. Let's start with how things are going economically here in the Grand Rapids area. What's your sense of the local economy?

**P1:** West Michigan is doing better than a lot of places, honestly. We've got the medical sector, furniture is still here, there's been some tech growth. But underneath that... I see a lot of anxiety. The costs are going up faster than wages.

**P3:** As a business owner, I can tell you - finding workers is impossible right now. I've got jobs paying 25, 30 bucks an hour that I can't fill. Guys would rather collect unemployment or work gig economy stuff.

**P9:** That's because 30 bucks an hour doesn't go as far as it used to. Rent in Grand Rapids has gone insane. Try finding an apartment for under $1,500 now. It used to be affordable here.

**P2:** The housing thing is real. My husband and I both work in healthcare, we make good money, and we still had to go way over budget on our house. Bought in Kentwood because we couldn't afford East Grand Rapids or Ada.

**P7:** I'm retired and on a fixed income. I worked at GM for 35 years. The pension was supposed to be enough. Now with inflation, I'm watching every penny. Never thought I'd be worried at this stage of life.

**P5:** I moved here from Chicago three years ago because it was supposed to be affordable. Tech job, good salary. But the cost of living has caught up fast. Not Chicago-level yet, but the gap is closing.

**MODERATOR:** What specifically is hitting your budgets hardest?

**P6:** Gas. I drive 30 minutes to work each way. When gas was over five dollars, I was spending $400 a month just on the commute. That's real money.

**P9:** For me it's everything. Groceries, gas, my truck payment went up because used car prices are ridiculous. I feel like I'm working harder and harder to stay in the same place.

**P2:** Childcare. We pay $2,200 a month for two kids in daycare. That's more than our mortgage. It's like having a second house payment.

**P4:** And school budgets are getting squeezed at the same time. We're asking teachers to do more with less while families are struggling to make ends meet.

**P10:** Property taxes here have gone up significantly because home values shot up. Great if you're selling, not so great if you're staying and paying the tax bill.

**P1:** At the plant, we gave raises this year but inflation ate it all up. Guys who got a three percent raise are actually making less in real terms. That's demoralizing.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you hold responsible for the economic situation?

**P3:** Both parties, honestly. They're all spending money we don't have. But if I had to pick - the current administration in Washington has been a disaster.

**P7:** I don't think the president controls gas prices. That's global. But they could do more. Why aren't we producing more oil domestically?

**P5:** This is the result of decades of policy, not one president. We've let wealth concentrate at the top while wages stagnated. That's bipartisan failure.

**P9:** Nobody in Lansing or Washington cares about people like me. They care about donors and lobbyists. I've stopped believing anything's going to change.

**P8:** I think COVID messed up the whole global economy and we're still sorting it out. Supply chains, labor markets, all of it. Hard to blame any one person.

**P10:** The Federal Reserve waited too long to address inflation. They were telling us it was "transitory" while prices kept going up. That's Fed policy, not state politics.

**P6:** I just know my grocery bill is double what it was. I don't care whose fault it is, I want someone to fix it.

### Governor Vanderberg: Home Turf Assessment (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Governor Vanderberg is from this area originally. How do you think he's done as governor?

**P3:** He's a West Michigan guy. Speaks our language. Pro-business. But I don't think he's delivered as much as he promised.

**P1:** He was supposed to be the business pragmatist. Fix the roads, cut red tape. The roads are still terrible. I blow a tire on 131 every other year.

**P6:** I voted for him four years ago. He seemed capable. I'm not angry at him but I'm not enthusiastic either.

**P10:** Competent but unimaginative. He's managed the state fine but hasn't really led on anything. No big ideas, no vision.

**P7:** He's been bad for working people. That tax cut he pushed went mostly to businesses and the wealthy. My property taxes are still high.

**P4:** Education funding has been flat under him while costs go up. He talks about schools but doesn't back it up with dollars.

**P8:** He's handled some things reasonably well. COVID response wasn't perfect but it wasn't as bad as some states. But he's been invisible lately.

**MODERATOR:** What do you think of his handling of the economy?

**P3:** He's brought some jobs here. The incentives for that battery plant were huge. But regular businesses like mine don't get that help.

**P5:** The tech incentives have been good. My company got some state credits. But it's all tilted toward certain industries. What about the workers at the furniture plant?

**P1:** Manufacturing has been mixed under him. Some plants expanded, others closed. He can't control global forces, but he doesn't seem to have a strategy for keeping manufacturing here.

**P9:** Politicians always take credit for jobs and blame others for losses. I don't know how much any governor actually controls.

**P7:** He cut the pension tax for some retirees but not all. I didn't qualify. It felt like a political calculation more than real policy.

**P6:** I like that he's not dramatic. After all the craziness in politics, having someone boring isn't the worst thing.

**P10:** "Not dramatic" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement though, is it? I want someone with actual plans.

**MODERATOR:** How would you rate his first term on a scale of 1-10?

**P1:** 5. Average.

**P2:** 4. Healthcare has been neglected.

**P3:** 6. Could be worse.

**P4:** 3. Education matters to me and he's failed.

**P5:** 5. Nothing terrible, nothing great.

**P6:** 6. Stable.

**P7:** 4. Hasn't helped working families.

**P8:** 5. Mediocre.

**P9:** 4. Politicians are all the same.

**P10:** 5. Wasted potential.

### Challenger Awareness and Perceptions (35:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Sarah Holloway, the Democratic challenger. What do you know about her?

**P6:** She was the Attorney General? I think I saw something about her on the news.

**P3:** I know she's a Democrat. That's about it. What's her background?

**P4:** She prosecuted people for the Flint water crisis. That was important. She actually held people accountable.

**P7:** I've seen her ads. She talks about her dad working at GM. Trying to connect with union folks like me.

**P10:** She's been AG for four years. What has she actually accomplished? I'd like to know her record.

**MODERATOR:** For those who don't know much, what would you want to learn about her?

**P1:** What's her plan for manufacturing? West Michigan has been losing factory jobs. Does she have a strategy or just slogans?

**P3:** Is she going to raise my taxes? That's what I need to know. Democrats usually want to raise taxes on business owners.

**P9:** What's she actually going to do differently? They all talk the same. I want to see something concrete.

**P2:** Where does she stand on healthcare costs? Prescription drugs? That affects my patients every day.

**P6:** What about her personally? Is she a moderate Democrat or one of these far-left progressives? That matters to me.

**P5:** I'd want to know her position on tech and innovation. Is she going to invest in the future economy?

**P7:** Social Security and Medicare. Is she going to protect them? That's my lifeline.

**P8:** Abortion is a big issue for me right now. What's her position and what can she actually do about it?

**MODERATOR:** Has anyone seen her campaign materials or heard her speak?

**P4:** I saw a town hall she did in Lansing. She came across as smart and prepared. Knew the issues.

**P7:** The ad about her dad was effective. "His hands built Michigan cars." That's a good line.

**P3:** I've seen the attack ads about her being soft on crime. Don't know if that's true or not.

**P8:** She did an interview on Channel 8 here. She was personable. Answered questions directly, didn't dodge.

**P10:** I've looked at her website. Her platform is pretty standard Democratic stuff. Nothing surprising.

### Issue Deep Dive: Manufacturing and Jobs (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's dig into jobs and manufacturing since this is such a manufacturing-heavy region. What's your sense of the future of manufacturing here?

**P1:** I've been in furniture manufacturing for 25 years. We're surviving but not thriving. The skilled trades shortage is killing us. Kids don't want to work in factories anymore.

**P7:** When I started at GM in the '80s, a factory job was a ticket to the middle class. Good wages, benefits, pension. Now those jobs are either gone or don't pay like they used to.

**P3:** I hire electricians, HVAC techs. These are good jobs - $60, $70K a year. But I can't find people. The trades have a image problem. Everyone wants to go to college and sit at a computer.

**P9:** I'm an electrician and I do fine. But I had to work my way up. Starting wages are still low. Apprenticeships don't pay much.

**P5:** Tech is the future of jobs in this region. Medical devices, software, automation. Manufacturing isn't going away but it's going to require different skills.

**P1:** That's the problem though. What happens to the guys on the line who've been doing the same job for 20 years? They can't all become coders.

**MODERATOR:** What should the state be doing to support manufacturing and workers?

**P7:** Job training that actually leads somewhere. Not just programs that look good on paper but don't place people in real jobs.

**P4:** Investing in community colleges and trades education. We've let those programs wither. Not everyone needs a four-year degree.

**P3:** Cut regulations that strangle small businesses. I spend more time on paperwork than actually running my company some weeks.

**P9:** Actually enforce trade deals. China cheats. Mexico undercuts us. Politicians promise to get tough and then do nothing.

**P1:** We need a real industrial policy. Not just tax breaks for big companies but support for the whole supply chain. Small manufacturers, toolmakers, the whole ecosystem.

**P10:** Transportation infrastructure matters. Getting products to market efficiently. The roads and ports and rail lines.

**P2:** Healthcare costs are a huge burden on employers and workers. Fix healthcare and you help manufacturing competitiveness.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you a statement and get your reaction: "We need to bring manufacturing jobs back to Michigan by investing in our workers, cutting red tape for small businesses, and making sure goods made in Michigan can compete with goods made overseas."

**P1:** That's fine, but it's vague. Investing how? What red tape specifically?

**P3:** "Cut red tape" sounds good but everyone says it. Which regulations? Be specific.

**P9:** "Compete with overseas" - how? You can't compete with $2 an hour wages in China. What's the actual plan?

**P7:** "Investing in workers" could mean job training. That I support. But give me details.

**P5:** It's a good framework but needs substance. The direction is right.

---

### Message Testing (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** I'm going to read some specific policy proposals and get your reactions.

**MODERATOR:** First: "Create a $500 million fund to help Michigan manufacturers upgrade to advanced technology and automation, keeping jobs here while competing globally."

**P1:** Now that's interesting. Concrete money, specific purpose. Automation is how you compete.

**P3:** I'd want to know how it works. Can small businesses like mine access it, or is it just for big corporations?

**P5:** Smart policy. This is how you support manufacturing in the 21st century.

**P9:** Who decides who gets the money? Politicians picking winners and losers makes me nervous.

**P7:** If it keeps jobs here, I'm for it. But I want to see the jobs actually stay.

**MODERATOR:** Second: "Cap insulin at $35 a month and negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs to save Michigan families an average of $800 a year."

**P2:** As a healthcare provider, I love this. Medication costs are destroying families.

**P7:** $800 a year is real money. That's not just talk, that's tangible.

**P6:** I take blood pressure medication. Drug prices are ridiculous. This would help.

**P10:** Can a governor actually do this? Or is this federal?

**P8:** The insulin thing has bipartisan support. Even Republicans have backed it federally.

**P3:** I pay for my employees' health insurance. Lower drug costs help me too.

**MODERATOR:** Third: "Suspend the state gas tax for six months to give families immediate relief at the pump."

**P6:** Yes. Immediately. This would help so much.

**P9:** Finally something I can feel right now. Not some promise for five years from now.

**P1:** How do you pay for it though? Roads need to be fixed. Gas tax funds roads.

**P10:** It's a short-term fix that might make the infrastructure problem worse. I'm skeptical.

**P7:** At five dollars a gallon, I'll take any relief I can get.

**P3:** This could save my business real money. My trucks run on gas.

**P8:** I understand the appeal but it feels like a gimmick. What's the long-term plan?

**MODERATOR:** Fourth: "Sarah Holloway will protect your freedom to make your own healthcare decisions. She'll fight to keep politicians out of the doctor's office."

**P8:** This is important. After the Supreme Court ruling, I'm genuinely scared about what's next.

**P6:** I'm pro-life personally, but I don't think it's the government's place to decide. People should have their own choice.

**P4:** This is the right framing. "Freedom" and "keep politicians out." That works across party lines.

**P2:** As a healthcare provider, I cannot stress enough how much government interference is hurting patient care.

**P3:** I don't want the government in my business or my doctor's office. That's consistent.

**P7:** My wife feels strongly about this. It might be the issue that decides her vote.

**P9:** I don't have strong feelings on abortion, but "politicians out of the doctor's office" is common sense.

**P10:** This is a winning message. It's about freedom and privacy, not just abortion.

---

### Attack Response and Crime (78:00 - 88:00)

**MODERATOR:** Governor Vanderberg has been attacking Holloway as "soft on crime." What's your reaction to that?

**P3:** Crime in Grand Rapids has gotten worse. The downtown doesn't feel as safe as it used to. I don't know if that's her fault as AG.

**P9:** Politicians always run on crime. Both parties. I'm skeptical of the attacks.

**P10:** The AG prosecutes cases. Crime rates are affected by a million factors - poverty, policing, mental health. Blaming her seems simplistic.

**P4:** The "soft on crime" attack is lazy. It's what Republicans always say about Democrats.

**P7:** Crime was an issue before she was AG and it'll be an issue after. I don't buy that she's the problem.

**P6:** I want to be safe, but I also think some of these attacks are exaggerated to scare people.

**MODERATOR:** Let me show you an ad Vanderberg's campaign is running.

[Ad plays: Images of crime scenes, headlines about drug arrests, voiceover saying "Sarah Holloway let drug dealers walk free. She refused to prosecute violent criminals. Now she wants to be governor?"]

**P1:** That's pretty harsh. Is any of that true?

**P3:** If it's true, that's concerning. But how do I know it's not just campaign BS?

**P8:** The images are so dark and scary. It feels manipulative. Like they're trying to frighten me rather than inform me.

**P5:** This is why people hate politics. Just fear and attacks.

**P9:** I don't trust either side's ads. They all lie or stretch the truth.

**P4:** Show me the receipts. What cases specifically? Otherwise this is just noise.

**P7:** I've seen enough political ads to know they're all spin. I'd need to see real evidence.

**P6:** It makes me uncomfortable, but it also makes me want to know more about her record.

**P10:** Effective as a political tool, probably. But it makes me think less of Vanderberg for running it.

---

### Closing: Vote Choice and Movement (88:00 - 95:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final question. If you had to vote today, which way would you lean?

**P1:** Undecided, but leaning slightly toward Holloway. I want to hear more about her manufacturing plans.

**P2:** Holloway. Healthcare and abortion are my issues.

**P3:** Still undecided. Probably slight lean Vanderberg but I'm not happy about it.

**P4:** Holloway. Education matters and Vanderberg has failed.

**P5:** Holloway. I want someone with vision, not just a caretaker.

**P6:** Genuinely torn. I've always voted Republican but I'm not sure this time.

**P7:** Holloway. She seems to understand working people better.

**P8:** Holloway, mainly because of abortion rights. That's become my deciding issue.

**P9:** Still undecided. Might not vote at all honestly. Neither one inspires me.

**P10:** Leaning Holloway. Vanderberg has been mediocre. Time for a change.

**MODERATOR:** What would change your mind?

**P3:** If Holloway convinces me she won't raise taxes on my business, I could switch.

**P6:** If Vanderberg had a real plan for the economy. Not slogans, a real plan.

**P9:** If either one of them showed me they actually care about regular people and aren't just politicians.

**P1:** Specifics from Holloway on manufacturing. Detailed, credible plans.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Economic anxiety is the dominant concern** - Even in a relatively strong economy, cost of living is squeezing everyone. This overshadows other issues except abortion.

2. **Vanderberg fatigue on home turf** - Even in his West Michigan base, he's seen as mediocre and uninspiring. Average rating of 4.7/10 is weak for an incumbent.

3. **Manufacturing decline creates identity crisis** - This is a manufacturing community that sees its economic identity eroding. Candidates need to address this directly and credibly.

4. **Specificity is demanded** - This group was even more insistent on concrete details than typical. Generic promises are rejected. They want numbers, plans, mechanisms.

5. **Abortion reaches across lines** - P6 (Dutch Reformed, traditional values) said "it's not the government's place." The freedom framing works even with conservative-leaning voters.

6. **Skilled trades gap is deeply felt** - Multiple participants mentioned the difficulty finding skilled workers. Job training and trades education emerged as a real policy interest.

7. **Attack ads generate skepticism** - The crime ad prompted as much skepticism about Vanderberg as concern about Holloway. Negative campaigning has diminishing returns with these voters.

### Surprising Moments

- **P6 (traditional values, Republican) open to Democrats on abortion** - "I'm pro-life personally but it's not the government's place." This represents potential suburban shift.

- **P3 (small business owner, Republican) wanted to hear Holloway's manufacturing plan** - Opened to potentially switching if she's credible on economy.

- **Healthcare costs as manufacturing issue** - Multiple participants connected healthcare costs to business competitiveness. This is an angle for economic messaging.

- **P9's disengagement is real** - "Might not vote at all." This type of voter needs to be given a reason to participate.

### Participant Movement

- **Moved toward Holloway:** P1, P5, P6 (tentative), P10
- **Confirmed Holloway:** P2, P4, P7, P8
- **Stayed undecided/Vanderberg lean:** P3, P9

### Recommended Follow-up

1. **Develop detailed manufacturing agenda** - This audience demands specifics. The $500M advanced manufacturing fund got positive response. Build out the plan.

2. **Connect healthcare costs to economic competitiveness** - "Fix healthcare and you help manufacturing" was a powerful insight. Healthcare policy is economic policy.

3. **Trades education message** - Community colleges, apprenticeships, skilled trades. This addresses labor shortage and economic opportunity together.

4. **Test "change vs. more of the same" framing** - Vanderberg is seen as mediocre. Holloway as change candidate could work here.

5. **Gas tax suspension is mixed** - Some loved the immediacy, others worried about road funding. Need to address the infrastructure tradeoff.

6. **Abortion message works, don't oversaturate** - Even in West Michigan, "freedom" framing resonates. But keep economic messaging primary.

### Demographic Notes

- **Small business owners** skeptical of both parties but reachable on specifics
- **Union retirees** (P7) motivated by economic security and pension protection
- **Suburban professional women** (P8, P10) moving on abortion but want economic competence
- **Working-class men** (P9) most at risk for non-voting - need direct reason to engage
- **Religious conservatives** (P6) potentially movable on abortion overreach
