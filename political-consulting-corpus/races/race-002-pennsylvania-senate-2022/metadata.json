  "notes": "Candidate's working-class Scranton roots provided powerful contrast with opponent's hedge fund background. Abortion was galvanizing in Philly suburbs. Economic messaging landed when tied to specific policies and personal story. Opponent's 'outsider' status and wealth became major liability. Union endorsements were asset but required activation."
