## Discussion

### Opening: Life in NEPA Today (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thanks everyone for being here tonight. Let's start by talking about life here in Northeastern Pennsylvania. How are things going for you and your families?

**P1:** I've lived here my whole life. Worked at the distribution center for 15 years. It's a decent job but the cost of everything is eating my paycheck. Gas to get to work, groceries, my daughter's about to go to college and I don't know how we're going to pay for it.

**P5:** I'm retired on disability from the mines. Black lung. The pension is okay but it doesn't go up with inflation. Every year I fall a little more behind.

**P2:** I take care of elderly people in their homes. It's hard work and it doesn't pay much - $14 an hour. But I love my clients. I'm also taking care of my own mother who has dementia. I'm stretched thin.

**P6:** I'm 33, supposed to be building a life. I have $60,000 in student loans for a medical billing degree. I make $38,000 a year. You do the math. I live with my boyfriend just to afford rent.

**P7:** I run a small HVAC business. Work is actually good right now - people need heating and cooling. But my costs are up 40%. I can't pass all of that to customers. My margins are getting squeezed.

**P3:** I drive a truck, regional routes. I'm on the road a lot, so gas prices hit me personally even though the company pays for fuel. And when I'm home, I see my wife stressed about the grocery bill.

**P10:** I deal cards at the casino. It's okay money but the hours are brutal. I work nights and weekends. I barely see my family. And now with inflation, what I make doesn't go as far.

**MODERATOR:** When you think about the economy here in NEPA specifically, what's your sense?

**P4:** Scranton has come back some. The downtown is nicer than it was. But drive 20 minutes in any direction and you see struggling towns, empty storefronts. The recovery is uneven.

**P5:** The coal industry is gone. That was the backbone of this region. We never really replaced it with anything comparable.

**P9:** There are jobs but they're not the jobs our parents had. Warehouse work, healthcare, casinos. Not bad jobs, but not like the union factory jobs that built the middle class.

**P8:** I work part-time at the school cafeteria. $12.50 an hour, no benefits. I need full-time but they won't give it to me because then they'd have to offer health insurance.

**P1:** Amazon came here, the warehouses. Jobs, sure. But they work you hard and they don't treat you like a person. It's not like the old days when a job meant something.

### Local Connection: Tony Marchetti (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Tony Marchetti is from Scranton. Let's talk about that. What do you know about him and does his local connection matter?

**P4:** I know Tony. Not personally know him, but I know who he is. His family's been here forever. He went to Scranton Prep, then to the University of Scranton. He's legit from here.

**P5:** His father worked at the Chamberlain plant. My brother knew him. Steel. Real work. That family knows what it means to earn a paycheck with your hands.

**P1:** I remember when he was mayor. He was everywhere - at the St. Patrick's Day parade, at La Festa Italiana, at the football games. He showed up.

**P3:** Does he still live here or did he move to Harrisburg?

**P4:** He kept his house in Green Ridge. When he's not in Harrisburg for LG work, he's here.

**P10:** I don't know much about politics but I've seen him around. He seems like a regular guy. Not like a politician.

**MODERATOR:** Why does local connection matter to you?

**P9:** Because people who aren't from here don't understand us. They think Pennsylvania is Philadelphia on one end and Pittsburgh on the other. NEPA is its own thing.

**P2:** If he grew up here, he knows what it's like. The struggles, the pride, the way people look out for each other.

**P7:** Local means accountable. I could run into him at Coopers. He can't hide from his neighbors.

**P5:** We've seen politicians come through here making promises and then forget we exist. Tony can't do that - his mother still goes to St. Peter's Cathedral.

**P6:** I'm more skeptical. Being from here is nice but what's he going to do for us? That's what I want to know.

**MODERATOR:** What are your impressions of his time as mayor?

**P4:** Good. He brought some investment downtown. The mall area started coming back. He kept taxes reasonable.

**P1:** He was visible. You saw him at community events. He wasn't sitting in an office somewhere.

**P8:** My sister worked for the city when he was mayor. She said he was fair to the employees. Respected the unions.

**P3:** I don't remember anything bad. Which for a politician is pretty good.

**P10:** I didn't pay attention to local politics then, honestly.

### Contrast with Thornton (38:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about David Thornton? What's your impression?

**P1:** The Wall Street guy? What's he doing running for Senate in Pennsylvania? Isn't he from New York?

**P5:** He's a billionaire. That's all I need to know. Billionaires don't understand working people.

**P7:** I saw him on TV and he was awkward. Like he was reading from a script someone else wrote.

**P6:** I looked him up. He ran a hedge fund. Made a ton of money in finance. What does that have to do with Scranton?

**P9:** He's trying to buy the election. Must be nice to be able to write a $50 million check to your own campaign.

**P4:** He has no connection to this area. Has he ever even been to NEPA before the campaign?

**P3:** Some of his ads are about crime and immigration. Those are real issues. But I don't trust him to actually help us.

**P2:** What's his healthcare plan? Does he even have one?

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you a contrast statement: "Tony Marchetti is Scranton's son. His father worked at Chamberlain Steel. He went to Scranton Prep and the University of Scranton. He's raised his family here. He's one of us. David Thornton is a Wall Street billionaire who moved to Pennsylvania a decade ago and now wants to buy our Senate seat. He's never worked a day in his life."

**P5:** That's harsh but true. Tony IS one of us. Thornton is not.

**P1:** "Scranton's son" is good. That resonates.

**P4:** "Never worked a day in his life" - is that fair? He ran a business.

**P7:** Running a hedge fund isn't work. It's gambling with other people's money.

**P10:** The contrast is stark. One is local, one is not. Simple.

**P6:** I like the specifics - Scranton Prep, U of S, Chamberlain. Those are real places we know.

**P9:** This makes the choice clear. Us versus them.

### Economic Issues Deep Dive (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about economic issues. What do you need from a senator?

**P6:** Student loan relief. Biden did some but I still owe a lot. Why is higher education so expensive? Why are we punishing people for getting educated?

**P2:** Healthcare. I take care of people who can't afford their medications. It's heartbreaking. Something has to change.

**P5:** Protect Social Security and Medicare. I rely on both. Anyone who threatens them loses my vote instantly.

**P7:** Small business support. Tax breaks for hiring, help with health insurance costs. I want to offer my employees benefits but I can't afford it.

**P1:** Good jobs. Not just any jobs - good jobs. Union jobs with benefits. Jobs you can raise a family on.

**P3:** Trade policy. The trucking industry is affected by everything - tariffs, fuel costs, regulations. I want someone who understands how the economy actually works.

**MODERATOR:** What do you think a senator can actually do about these things?

**P5:** They vote on Social Security. They vote on Medicare. Those are Senate votes.

**P9:** They confirm judges. That matters for everything now, as we've seen.

**P4:** They can bring attention to issues. Fight for their state. Some senators do that, some don't.

**P6:** Student loans are federal policy. The Senate can change it.

**P7:** They can fight against regulations that hurt small business. Or support them. Depends on the senator.

**MODERATOR:** Let me test an economic message: "Tony Marchetti will fight to lower costs for NEPA families - capping prescription drug prices, cutting gas taxes to give immediate relief, and protecting Social Security and Medicare from politicians who want to cut them."

**P5:** Protecting Social Security - that's my number one issue.

**P2:** Prescription drug prices, yes. My mother's medications are a fortune.

**P3:** Gas tax cut would help. I feel it every time I fill up.

**P7:** "NEPA families" - I like that he's speaking to us specifically.

**P1:** Concrete things. Not just slogans. Specific policies.

**P6:** It's good but I want to know about student loans too.

**P10:** Covers the basics that affect regular people.

### Abortion and Values (68:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. How is that affecting this election for you?

**P4:** I'm Catholic. This is hard for me. I was always taught abortion is wrong. But these total bans - no exceptions for rape? I can't support that.

**P2:** As someone who cares for sick and elderly people, I believe in compassion. What about women who have medical emergencies? These laws are cruel.

**P6:** I'm pro-choice, full stop. It's my body. But I also understand other people see it differently.

**P8:** My daughter is 16. The idea that her options could be limited terrifies me.

**P1:** I'm conflicted on this. I'm not comfortable with abortion but I'm also not comfortable with government making these decisions.

**P9:** I'm pro-life but I vote on other issues too. Economy, crime. Abortion isn't my single issue.

**P5:** At my age, this isn't personal for me. But my granddaughter is in college. I think about her future.

**P3:** My wife is very worked up about this. More than I've ever seen her on a political issue.

**MODERATOR:** Where do the candidates stand?

**P6:** Marchetti is pro-choice. He's been clear.

**P9:** Thornton is dodging. Won't give a straight answer. That tells you something.

**P4:** If Thornton supports his party's position, that means total bans. That's too extreme.

**P10:** I don't follow this closely but I don't want politicians making medical decisions for women.

### Closing: Vote Intent and Hometown Factor (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final section. How are you voting in this Senate race?

**P1:** Marchetti. He's one of us. His dad worked at the plant like my dad did.

**P2:** Marchetti. Healthcare is my issue and I trust him more on that.

**P3:** Leaning Marchetti. I want to hear more on trade and trucking issues, but he's got my lean.

**P4:** Marchetti. Even though I'm conflicted on abortion, the hometown connection matters and Thornton is just too out of touch.

**P5:** Marchetti, absolutely. He'll protect Social Security. He knows what working people need.

**P6:** Marchetti. I want student loan relief and Republicans aren't offering that.

**P7:** Marchetti. I'm a small business guy who usually votes on economics. Thornton's policies would help billionaires, not me.

**P8:** Marchetti. He seems like he cares about regular people.

**P9:** Probably Marchetti. I like law and order candidates, which Republicans usually are, but Thornton isn't credible on anything.

**P10:** Marchetti. He's from here. That's not everything but it's something.

**MODERATOR:** What role does the hometown connection play in your decision?

**P4:** It's significant. Not the only thing, but it means he'll understand us, fight for us.

**P5:** It's everything. Scranton's been overlooked for too long. Having one of our own in the Senate would be huge.

**P1:** It means accountability. He can't forget where he came from when he literally still lives here.

**P6:** It matters less to me than policy, but it's a plus. It's nice to have someone who gets us.

**P9:** It builds trust. He's not some outsider who parachuted in to take advantage of us.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time and honesty tonight.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Hometown connection is decisive** - In NEPA, Marchetti's Scranton roots are an unbeatable advantage. "Scranton's son," "his dad worked at Chamberlain," "he still goes to St. Peter's" - this local knowledge creates deep trust.

2. **Economic anxiety spans all participants** - From the $12.50/hour cafeteria worker to the small business owner, everyone feels squeezed. "Running to stay in place" captures the sentiment.

3. **Thornton's outsider status is fatal** - "What's he doing running for Senate in Pennsylvania?" captures the reaction. Wealth plus outsider status equals rejection.

4. **Social Security/Medicare is non-negotiable** - P5 represents many: "Anyone who threatens them loses my vote instantly."

5. **Abortion is complicating traditional loyalties** - P4 (Catholic, traditional values) is voting Democratic because bans "go too far." This is realignment in action.

6. **Union heritage persists even among non-union workers** - References to mining, steel, factory culture shape identity. "Jobs you can raise a family on" is aspirational.

7. **Local accountability matters** - "I could run into him at Coopers" - small community dynamics create perceived accountability.

### Strongest Messages

1. **Hometown biography** - Every Scranton-specific detail lands: Scranton Prep, U of S, Chamberlain, St. Peter's
2. **Social Security protection** - Existential for older voters
3. **"One of us vs. Wall Street billionaire"** - Class contrast amplified by geography

### Participant Movement

- All 10 leaning or committed to Marchetti
- P3 and P9 are softest supporters but still leaning Marchetti
- Hometown connection tipped P4 and P9 who might otherwise be persuadable

### NEPA-Specific Insights

- **Overlooked region identity** - "NEPA is its own thing" - feeling of being ignored by both Philadelphia and Harrisburg
- **Coal/steel heritage** - Still defining even decades after decline
- **Biden connection** - Scranton is "Biden's hometown" too - Marchetti benefits from same local credibility
- **Community accountability** - Small-town dynamics where "everyone knows everyone"

### Recommended Actions

1. **Heavy NEPA investment** - This is home turf. Over-perform here to offset potential weakness elsewhere.
2. **Local validators** - City council members, union locals, church leaders who can vouch for Marchetti
3. **Economic specificity for NEPA** - What industries are you bringing here? How will you help small towns beyond Scranton?
4. **Chamberlain/steel story** - Father's work history should be in every piece of literature
5. **Social Security TV ads** - Run constantly on local stations

### Verbatim Quotes for Campaign
