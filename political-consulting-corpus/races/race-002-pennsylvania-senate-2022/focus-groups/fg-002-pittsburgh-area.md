## Discussion

### Opening: Economic Reality in the Mon Valley (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Let's start with how things are going economically for your families right now.

**P1:** I'll be straight with you - things are tight. I make good money at the mill, $85K with overtime. But between the mortgage, the car payments, and everything costing more, it doesn't feel like I'm getting ahead. It feels like I'm running to stay in place.

**P2:** I'm a single mom. I work full time in a hospital cafeteria. I make $17 an hour. After rent and food and getting my kids to school, there's nothing left. My union fought for that $17 - it used to be $12. But $17 still isn't enough.

**P3:** I drive for UPS. Good job, good benefits thanks to the Teamsters. But my wife doesn't have union benefits at her job and her healthcare costs are insane. Every year the premiums go up.

**P9:** I managed a grocery store through the whole pandemic. We were "essential workers" but nobody treated us essential. We got sick, we kept working, and now they're cutting hours because profits are down. Where's the loyalty?

**P6:** Construction is actually doing okay right now. Infrastructure money is flowing. But the cost of living... man. I want to buy a house in McKees Rocks where I grew up, and I can't afford it. Houses that were $80K five years ago are $200K now.

**P5:** I'm retired, fixed income. The pension is good - thank God for the union - but inflation is eating away at it. I'm worried about Social Security. Every election Republicans talk about cutting it.

**MODERATOR:** What's driving these cost increases you're feeling?

**P1:** Everything. Gas was the killer this summer. I've got a truck - needed for the job - and it was costing me $100 to fill it. Groceries are insane. My wife says the same cart that used to be $150 is now $250.

**P7:** Healthcare costs. I work at UPMC - the biggest healthcare system in the region - and my own insurance is barely affordable. The deductible is $4,000. I'm a nurse making decent money and I put off going to the doctor because of the cost.

**P4:** Teachers in Pennsylvania are actually paid okay compared to other states. But my husband was laid off during COVID and only found part-time work. We're a union household but we're still struggling.

**P8:** Gas, groceries, and rent. The trifecta. I'm driving a bus, I see what the city looks like. There are homeless camps that weren't there five years ago. Something is broken.

**P10:** The economy is complicated. Unemployment is low, jobs are available. But the jobs don't pay what they used to relative to costs. A union electrician job was middle class. Now it's barely middle class.

### Union Identity and Politics (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** You're all in union households. How does that shape how you vote?

**P10:** The union is my political education. Before I was in IBEW, I didn't think about politics much. Now I understand that every election affects my job, my pension, my healthcare.

**P1:** USW endorsed Biden. I voted for Biden. But I know guys at the mill who didn't. Trump talked about bringing steel back and some of them believed him.

**P3:** Teamsters give us information about candidates but they don't tell us what to do. I make my own decisions. I look at who's actually going to help working people.

**P5:** AFSCME has been good about educating members. But I'll tell you - some of the younger guys don't trust the union leadership like we used to. They think everyone's out for themselves.

**P2:** SEIU fights hard for us. Healthcare workers, service workers. Democrats are better for us, period. But Democrats need to show up, not just assume they have our votes.

**P6:** I'll be honest - I almost voted for Trump in 2016. I was frustrated, felt like nobody was listening. The union got me back on track, reminded me who actually supports working people.

**MODERATOR:** Is the union endorsement important to your vote?

**P10:** It matters to me. The union does the research. They know who shows up for us and who doesn't.

**P1:** It's one factor but not the only one. I listen to the endorsement but I also listen to my gut.

**P8:** Democrats have taken union voters for granted too long. NAFTA hurt us. Trade deals hurt us. Now they're surprised when some members go Republican?

**P4:** AFT endorsed Biden and I was fine with that. But on local races I do my own research. The endorsement is a starting point.

**P9:** Endorsements matter less than they used to because trust is lower overall. People are skeptical of all institutions.

**P7:** I'm not in a union anymore - UPMC won't let us organize - but I was raised union. My dad was UMWA. That identity stays with you.

### Candidate Awareness: Tony Marchetti (35:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Tony Marchetti, the Democratic Senate candidate. What do you know about him?

**P10:** Marchetti is the real deal. Lieutenant Governor, Scranton guy. His family is just like ours - working people who built this state.

**P1:** I've seen him at union events. He shows up. Doesn't just show up for elections - he shows up.

**P4:** His father was a steelworker, right? Or was it coal?

**P10:** Steel. Worked at the mill in Scranton area. Just like the mills here.

**P6:** I saw a video where he talked about his dad's hands being permanently stained from the work. That's real. That's what my grandfather looked like.

**P7:** My father had hands like that too. He worked at J&L Steel for 38 years. Started right out of high school in '61. Back then you could walk out of South High and into the mill the same day. Good money, good benefits. He bought a house in Hazelwood, raised four kids. When the mills closed in the '80s it destroyed him. Took early retirement, but really he was just— I mean, the whole neighborhood emptied out. People lost their houses, their—

**MODERATOR:** P7, I appreciate that story - it's powerful. We're going to come back to the mills and what happened. For now, can we stay focused on the candidates?

**P7:** Sorry. I get going on this stuff. It's personal.

**MODERATOR:** No, it's important. We'll have time for it.

**P3:** I don't know much about him but the working-class background is good. We need people who understand us.

**P5:** He was mayor of Scranton. Did he do a good job? That matters.

**P10:** He did. Brought back downtown, attracted investment, kept taxes reasonable. Practical guy.

**P8:** What's his position on public transit? Buses, light rail? That affects my job directly.

**P2:** I want to know about healthcare. Will he fight for us?

**MODERATOR:** What's your overall impression?

**P1:** Positive. He's one of us.

**P6:** He feels authentic. Not some politician reading talking points.

**P7:** I like that he's not from Philadelphia or the suburbs. Western PA and NEPA are different. He gets that.

**P4:** Italian name, Scranton roots, union family. That's Pennsylvania.

**P9:** He's saying the right things. But politicians always say the right things. I want to see action.

### Candidate Awareness: David Thornton (50:00 - 62:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about David Thornton, the Republican candidate?

**P1:** The hedge fund guy? [Scoffs] What does he know about working for a living?

**P10:** Thornton is everything that's wrong with the Republican party. A billionaire who thinks he can buy a Senate seat.

**P6:** I saw him on TV trying to act like a regular guy. It was embarrassing. You could tell he'd never been in a union hall in his life.

**P3:** He's not even from Pennsylvania originally, right? Some Wall Street type who moved here?

**P8:** His ads are everywhere. He's got money, I'll give him that. But money isn't the only thing that matters.

**P2:** What are his healthcare positions? That's what I want to know.

**P10:** He wants to cut Medicare. He's talked about "reforming entitlements." That's code for cuts.

**P5:** [Alarmed] Cut Medicare? I'm on Medicare. That's not happening if I can help it.

**P7:** He's supported by the same people who want to destroy unions. Chamber of Commerce types.

**P4:** The ads about him are brutal but they seem accurate. Born rich, stayed rich, doesn't understand regular people.

**P9:** I don't trust anyone that wealthy. They don't know what it's like to decide between groceries and medicine.

**MODERATOR:** Any positives?

**P3:** He's not an extremist in the Trump mold, I guess? Not like some of these crazy candidates.

**P6:** That's a low bar.

**P1:** I'll give him credit for being honest about being rich. But that doesn't make me want to vote for him.

### Economic Messaging Deep Dive (62:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let me test some economic messages with you. First: "We need to bring back American manufacturing and make sure the jobs of the future are good union jobs with benefits."

**P1:** Yes. This is the message. This is what we need to hear.

**P10:** "Jobs of the future" is important. We can't just be nostalgic. Green energy, batteries, tech - those need to be union jobs too.

**P6:** Who's going to build all these wind turbines and solar panels? We are. But only if they're union jobs.

**P4:** The jobs of the future have to be good jobs. Not gig economy garbage with no benefits.

**P5:** Manufacturing matters but so do service jobs. Hospital workers, grocery workers - those are real jobs too.

**MODERATOR:** Second message: "David Thornton made his fortune betting against American companies and shipping jobs overseas. Now he wants to be your senator? Don't let Wall Street billionaires write the rules."

**P1:** [Emphatic] Yes. That's exactly what happened. Guys like him profited from destroying our communities.

**P8:** "Betting against American companies" - if that's true, that's disqualifying.

**P3:** Hedge funds are parasites. They don't build anything. They just extract value.

**P7:** The contrast is clear. One guy's family built things. The other guy's family profited from tearing things down.

**P10:** "Don't let Wall Street write the rules" - that should be on a billboard on Route 30.

**P6:** This is the kind of ad that will work in the Mon Valley. People here understand what Wall Street did to us.

**MODERATOR:** Third message: "Tony Marchetti will fight to protect Social Security and Medicare - because he knows these programs are a lifeline for working families. David Thornton has called them 'unsustainable' and supports raising the retirement age. Who's really on your side?"

**P5:** You touch my Social Security, you lose my vote. Period. I paid into that system for 40 years.

**P2:** Medicare is everything for my mom. Without it, she'd be bankrupt from her medications.

**P1:** Raising the retirement age is a backdoor cut. We can't work in the mill until we're 70.

**P7:** Healthcare costs and retirement security - these are life and death issues. This message lands.

**P8:** Democrats need to hammer this. Every single day. Republicans want to cut your benefits.

**P10:** Social Security and Medicare are union issues. We fight for these because they affect our members.

### Abortion and Social Issues (78:00 - 86:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's briefly discuss abortion. How is that issue playing in your communities?

**P4:** In education circles, it's a huge issue. Teachers are overwhelmingly pro-choice. It's a motivator.

**P7:** Healthcare workers - same. We see what happens when people can't access care.

**P2:** For working women, especially poor women, this is terrifying. If you can't afford childcare and you get pregnant... there's no safety net.

**P6:** I'll be honest, I grew up Catholic. This is complicated for me. But I've come around to thinking it should be a personal decision, not government.

**P1:** In the mill, guys don't talk about abortion much. But their wives and daughters are talking about it.

**P5:** My generation is more conservative on this, but even we think the bans go too far. No exceptions? That's extreme.

**P3:** My wife is furious about the Supreme Court decision. She's more motivated to vote than I've ever seen her.

**P10:** The union position is pro-choice because it's about workers' rights. Bodily autonomy is a union value.

**P8:** This issue is moving voters who normally don't vote. I see it on my bus route - women are engaged.

**P9:** Grocery store workers are mostly women. This matters to them. It's personal.

### Closing: Vote Intent and Persuasion (86:00 - 95:00)

**MODERATOR:** Final question. How are you voting in this Senate race and what would change your mind?

**P1:** Marchetti. He's union, he's one of us. Nothing's changing my mind.

**P2:** Marchetti. He'll fight for healthcare workers.

**P3:** Marchetti. The Teamsters endorsed him, he's got the background. Done deal.

**P4:** Marchetti. Education and abortion.

**P5:** Marchetti. He won't touch my Social Security. That's all I need to know.

**P6:** Marchetti. I considered Thornton for about five minutes. No way I'm voting for a billionaire hedge fund guy.

**P7:** Marchetti. Healthcare is my issue.

**P8:** Marchetti. But I want him to show up for transit workers. That's my ask.

**P9:** Marchetti. He's the working person's candidate.

**P10:** Marchetti, obviously. This isn't even close. The contrast couldn't be clearer.

**MODERATOR:** What would Thornton have to do to win your vote?

**P1:** [Laughs] Be a completely different person?

**P10:** There's nothing. He is who he is. A billionaire will never understand us.

**P6:** He'd have to come work in the trades for a year. Actually break a sweat.

**P5:** Promise to never touch Social Security and Medicare. Signed in blood. [Group laughs]

**P3:** Some of these Republicans think they can win union voters. Not this union voter. Not this year.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time and your candor.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Economic pressure is universal** - Every participant, from $17/hour service workers to $85K steelworkers, feels squeezed. The "running to stay in place" metaphor is powerful.

2. **Union identity remains strong** - This is a union-proud room. Endorsements matter, union values shape political thinking, even among those with some cross-pressures.

3. **Marchetti's background is perfect fit** - Working-class Scranton roots, steel family, showing up at union events. He's "one of us" without having to prove it.

4. **Thornton's wealth is fatal liability** - "Hedge fund guy," "billionaire," "betting against America" - every mention of his background drew negative reaction.

5. **Social Security/Medicare is non-negotiable** - The strongest reactions came on retirement security. This is life and death for these voters.

6. **Class consciousness is alive** - "Wall Street billionaires write the rules," "guys like him profited from destroying our communities" - there's genuine class awareness here.

7. **Abortion is mobilizing even this demographic** - Surprised by engagement on reproductive rights. Union values extend to bodily autonomy.

### Strongest Messages

1. **"Don't let Wall Street billionaires write the rules"** - Unanimous enthusiasm
2. **Social Security/Medicare protection** - Existential issue for older participants
3. **"Made his fortune betting against American companies"** - Devastating framing if accurate

### Participant Unanimity

All 10 participants committed to Marchetti. This is a 10-0 room. The question isn't who wins these voters but whether they turn out and bring friends.

### Union-Specific Insights

- **Endorsements still matter** but aren't automatic - members want to see candidates earn it
- **"Democrats took us for granted"** (P8) - real grievance that needs addressing
- **"Jobs of the future"** framing is important - unions understand they need to evolve
- **UPMC non-union status** (P7) is a regional sore point - organizing hospitals is local issue

### Recommended Actions

1. **Schedule Mon Valley events** - This is base territory. Show up, fire them up, turn them out.
2. **Social Security ads in heavy rotation** - "Thornton wants to cut your benefits" is devastating.
3. **Labor Day visibility** - Major events in Pittsburgh area, Marchetti should be everywhere.
4. **Transit workers outreach** - P8's ask is real. Public transit matters in Allegheny County.
5. **"Betting against America" fact-check** - If Thornton's hedge fund shorted American companies, document it.

### Verbatim Quotes for Campaign

> "What does he know about working for a living?" - P1 (on Thornton)

> "His family is just like ours - working people who built this state." - P10 (on Marchetti)

> "You touch my Social Security, you lose my vote. Period." - P5

> "Hedge funds are parasites. They don't build anything. They just extract value." - P3

> "One guy's family built things. The other guy's family profited from tearing things down." - P7

> "I considered Thornton for about five minutes. No way I'm voting for a billionaire hedge fund guy." - P6
