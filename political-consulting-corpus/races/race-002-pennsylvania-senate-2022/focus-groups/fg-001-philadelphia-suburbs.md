## Discussion

### Opening: The State of Politics in the Philly Suburbs (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for coming tonight. Let's start with your general sense of where things stand politically, here in the Philadelphia suburbs specifically.

**P1:** The suburbs have changed so much politically. I've lived here 20 years and the shift is remarkable. This used to be reliably Republican territory. Now it's genuinely competitive.

**P6:** I'm a lifelong Republican and I barely recognize my party anymore. The Trump years were... distressing. I've voted Democratic for president the last two cycles for the first time in my life.

**P3:** I think a lot of us are looking for reasonable candidates. Not extremists on either side. The Main Line used to have moderate Republicans who'd work across the aisle. That species seems extinct.

**P4:** What I've noticed is that women here are really engaged, especially after the Supreme Court ruling. My book club has basically become a political organizing committee.

**P7:** The energy around abortion rights is real. It's not just Democrats - I know Republican women who are furious about what happened.

**P8:** Can I be honest? I'm exhausted by all of it. I run a business, I have a kid, I don't have time to follow every political battle. But some of this stuff - the abortion thing - it's too important to ignore.

**MODERATOR:** What issues are top of mind as you think about this Senate race?

**P2:** Abortion, obviously. But also just... competence. Do we want someone who's going to be a serious senator or a show pony?

**P5:** Education funding flows through Washington too. Student loan policy, school funding formulas. That matters to me professionally.

**P9:** Healthcare is a mess. I see it from inside the system. We need federal action on costs, on access. The Affordable Care Act needs strengthening.

**P10:** Economy and student loans. I finally bought a house but I still owe $80,000 in student debt. That shapes my whole financial life.

**P1:** Democracy, honestly. January 6th was horrifying. I need to know candidates believe in basic democratic norms.

**P6:** Character. I want senators with integrity. Policy matters but character matters more.

### Candidate Impressions: Tony Marchetti (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about the candidates. Tony Marchetti is the Democratic nominee. What do you know about him? What's your impression?

**P5:** He's the Lieutenant Governor. From Scranton originally. Working-class background, right?

**P1:** I've seen some coverage. His father worked in coal, I think? Or steel? Something blue-collar.

**P7:** He was mayor of Scranton before LG. Seemed like he did a good job there. Revitalized the downtown.

**P4:** I saw an interview where he talked about growing up without much money. His parents sacrificed for him to go to college. It felt genuine.

**P3:** Italian-American, clearly. Marchetti. That's a classic Pennsylvania name. Connects to a lot of families here.

**P6:** I don't know much about his positions but he seems like a reasonable person. Not a bomb-thrower.

**MODERATOR:** What's your impression of him as a person?

**P7:** Authentic. He doesn't seem like he's performing. When he talks about Scranton you can tell it's real.

**P2:** He came across as warm in the interviews I've seen. Relatable. Like someone you'd have a beer with.

**P1:** My impression is that he's a pragmatic Democrat, not an ideologue. That appeals to me.

**P8:** I honestly don't know much about him. Is he going to help small businesses? That's what I need to know.

**P9:** From a healthcare perspective, what's his plan? That's my question.

**P5:** He's been solid on education. Public school advocate.

**MODERATOR:** Any negatives or concerns about him?

**P3:** I'd want to know his economic policies in detail. Is he going to raise taxes significantly?

**P6:** I'm mildly concerned about how progressive he might be on some issues. But he seems moderate compared to some Democrats.

**P10:** I worry that all politicians make promises and don't deliver. Is he different?

### Candidate Impressions: David Thornton (35:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** Now let's talk about David Thornton, the Republican nominee. What do you know about him?

**P1:** Hedge fund guy, right? Made a fortune on Wall Street?

**P6:** He ran a very successful fund. Smart guy, certainly. But I don't know if that translates to being a good senator.

**P3:** I know people in finance who know him. Mixed reviews. Brilliant at making money, not sure about his people skills.

**P7:** He lives on the Main Line now but he's not really from here. Moved from... New York? Connecticut?

**P4:** He's only lived in Pennsylvania for like ten years. That bothers me. Carpet-bagger vibes.

**P2:** He's never held elected office, has he? Just decided he wants to be a senator?

**MODERATOR:** What's your impression of him as a person?

**P1:** He comes across as arrogant in interviews. There's this smugness, like he thinks he's the smartest person in the room.

**P6:** I've been in rooms with guys like him my whole career. Very confident, very smart, not always self-aware about how they come across.

**P8:** I saw an ad where he was trying to seem like a regular guy and it was painful. You can tell he's never shopped at Target.

**P3:** He's trying to run as a businessman who can fix things, but government isn't a hedge fund. You can't just fire people who disagree with you.

**P7:** He seems like someone who's never had to struggle for anything. Born wealthy, stayed wealthy. What does he know about regular people's lives?

**P9:** His healthcare positions worry me. He's talked about "market solutions" which usually means cutting coverage.

**MODERATOR:** Any positives?

**P3:** He's clearly intelligent. And business experience isn't worthless - we need people who understand the economy.

**P6:** I wanted to like him because I'm a Republican, but he's made it hard. Some of his statements have been... ill-advised.

**P4:** I give him credit for self-funding. He's not beholden to donors. But that also means he's a billionaire trying to buy a seat.

### Candidate Quality Contrast (55:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** When you compare the two candidates, what stands out?

**P1:** It's like two different worlds. One guy grew up working class, worked his way up. The other was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.

**P7:** Marchetti seems like he understands real life. Thornton seems like he understands spreadsheets.

**P4:** The relatability gap is huge. I could imagine having dinner with Marchetti. With Thornton, I'd feel like I was being evaluated.

**P5:** One cares about public service. The other sees this as another trophy to acquire.

**P6:** I say this as a Republican - Thornton has not run a good campaign. He's made unforced errors. That concerns me about his judgment.

**P3:** I'm conflicted. Policy-wise, I'm probably closer to Thornton. But competence and character... Marchetti seems more trustworthy.

**P2:** As a physician, I think about who I'd trust with my patients' wellbeing. It's Marchetti, without question.

**P8:** One seems real, one seems fake. I can't vote for fake.

**P9:** Healthcare is so important. Thornton's positions would hurt patients. That's disqualifying for me.

**P10:** They're from completely different universes. One understands student debt and housing costs. One has never had to think about those things.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you a potential contrast message: "Tony Marchetti grew up in Scranton, son of a steelworker. He paid his way through college, served his community as mayor, and fights for working families every day. David Thornton made billions on Wall Street, moved to Pennsylvania ten years ago, and now wants to buy a Senate seat. Pennsylvania deserves a senator who understands our struggles, not a billionaire who's never had one."

**P1:** That's devastatingly effective. It's all true and it draws the contrast perfectly.

**P7:** Yes. This is exactly the difference.

**P4:** "Buy a Senate seat" is strong but accurate.

**P6:** [Sighs] I can't argue with any of it. This is why I'm struggling.

**P3:** It's negative but substantive. Based on real differences, not personal attacks.

**P5:** This should be the campaign's core message.

**P8:** Simple, clear, memorable. This would move voters.

### Abortion Deep Dive (68:00 - 80:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's discuss abortion and reproductive rights. The Supreme Court overturned Roe this summer. How is that affecting this race for you?

**P1:** It's become central. I was already planning to vote Democratic but this galvanized me. I have a daughter. I'm terrified about her future.

**P2:** I'm a pediatrician. I deal with adolescent health. The implications of these bans for young women are horrifying. Doctors are scared to provide care.

**P7:** I've always been pro-choice but this felt abstract before. Now it's real. Rights I grew up with are gone.

**P4:** I've had friends text me asking where they can get birth control stockpiled. The anxiety is real.

**P5:** Students in my school are talking about it. Teenage girls worried about their futures. It's heartbreaking.

**P6:** I'm pro-choice and this is one of the issues where I've broken with my party. The overreach is extreme.

**P3:** I'm more conservative on this issue than most people in this room, probably. But even I think the absolute bans are too far.

**P8:** I was a single issue voter on taxes for years. Now abortion has become my single issue. It's that important.

**P9:** From a medical perspective, these laws are dangerous. They interfere with medical judgment.

**P10:** My generation assumed we'd always have these rights. We were wrong. Never taking it for granted again.

**MODERATOR:** Where do the candidates stand?

**P7:** Marchetti is strongly pro-choice. He's been clear about it.

**P2:** Thornton has waffled. He said something about "states deciding" which is code for allowing bans.

**P6:** Thornton's position is deliberately unclear. That tells me he'd vote with his party, which means restrictions.

**P1:** A vote for Thornton is a vote against abortion rights. Period.

**P3:** That's probably fair. Even if he personally might be moderate, he'd be under party pressure.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read a message: "Tony Marchetti will protect your right to make your own healthcare decisions. He'll fight to restore Roe v. Wade and ensure Pennsylvania women have access to reproductive care. David Thornton won't commit to protecting abortion rights - because he knows his party wants to ban it nationwide. The choice is clear."

**P1:** Powerful and accurate.

**P7:** "Won't commit" is the key phrase. His silence speaks volumes.

**P4:** This is the ad I want to see on TV.

**P2:** Medically accurate and politically effective.

**P6:** I hate that this is where my party is, but it's true.

**P9:** Clear stakes, clear choice.

### Economic Issues and Closing (80:00 - 92:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's spend a few minutes on economic issues before we wrap up.

**P8:** The economy is my other big concern. My boutique is struggling. Inflation, supply chain, everything costs more.

**P10:** Student debt is crushing me even though I have a good job. The Biden forgiveness helps but I still owe a lot.

**P3:** Inflation is real but I also think the labor market is strong. Unemployment is low. It's a mixed picture.

**P9:** Healthcare costs are economic issues too. Medical bankruptcy is still too common.

**P1:** The economy matters but I don't think the Senate has that much control over short-term economic conditions. Inflation is global.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you trust more on the economy - Marchetti or Thornton?

**P3:** On paper, Thornton. He has economic expertise. But his policies would help people like him, not regular families.

**P6:** Thornton knows finance. That's different from understanding the economy regular people experience.

**P8:** Marchetti at least understands what it's like to struggle. Thornton has no idea.

**P1:** I trust Marchetti more. He'll prioritize working families. Thornton will prioritize his friends on Wall Street.

**P7:** Economic policy isn't just about GDP. It's about who benefits. Democrats want to distribute benefits more broadly.

**P10:** Marchetti talks about student debt and housing. Those are my issues. Thornton talks about capital gains taxes.

**MODERATOR:** Final question: How are you leaning and what would change your mind?

**P1:** Marchetti, firmly. Nothing would change my mind at this point.

**P2:** Marchetti. Healthcare and abortion are too important.

**P3:** Torn but leaning Marchetti. If Thornton showed real moderation on abortion, I might reconsider. He won't.

**P4:** Marchetti. The character contrast is decisive.

**P5:** Marchetti. Education and abortion.

**P6:** Probably Marchetti, which is strange for me to say. If the Republican Party nominated a reasonable moderate, I'd be there. They didn't.

**P7:** Marchetti, enthusiastically.

**P8:** Marchetti. He's real.

**P9:** Marchetti. Healthcare policy.

**P10:** Marchetti. He gets my generation's struggles.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your time and candor.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Candidate quality is decisive** - The contrast between Marchetti's working-class authenticity and Thornton's hedge-fund elitism dominated discussion. Character matters more than policy specifics for these voters.

2. **Abortion has realigned the suburbs** - Even traditionally Republican voters (P3, P6) are moving Democratic on this issue. The Dobbs decision mobilized this community profoundly.

3. **Thornton's wealth is liability, not asset** - "Never had to struggle," "buy a Senate seat," "born on third base" - his background is being used against him effectively.

4. **"Relatability gap" favors Marchetti** - Participants could imagine having dinner with Marchetti. Thornton feels like a "different universe."

5. **Economic populism lands in affluent suburbs** - Even wealthy professionals responded to working-class framing. The hedge fund vs. steelworker contrast resonates.

6. **Republican defections are real** - P3 and P6 are traditional Republicans seriously considering voting Democratic. This represents realignment.

### Strongest Messages Tested

1. **Marchetti-Thornton contrast** - "Son of a steelworker vs. wants to buy a Senate seat" - universally effective
2. **Abortion protection** - Direct, clear, tying Thornton to party position
3. **Character and authenticity** - "Real vs. fake" emerged organically

### Participant Movement

All 10 participants ended leaning or committed to Marchetti, including:
- P3: Traditional Republican, "torn but leaning Marchetti"
- P6: Country club Republican, "probably Marchetti, which is strange"

### Demographic Notes

- **Women (7 participants)** were unanimously energized by abortion, more likely to volunteer, highly engaged
- **Higher-income participants** still responded to working-class framing - identifies with values, not circumstances
- **Healthcare professionals** (P2, P9) particularly motivated by medical implications of abortion restrictions

### Recommended Actions

1. **Lead with candidate contrast** - Marchetti's biography vs. Thornton's background is the most powerful frame
2. **Don't let Thornton soften** - Hold him to his party's position on abortion; "won't commit" is key phrase
3. **Economic message through character lens** - "Understands your struggles" beats policy details
4. **Target suburban Republican women** - This group is movable and motivated
5. **Use "buy a Senate seat" carefully** - Powerful but ensure factual grounding
