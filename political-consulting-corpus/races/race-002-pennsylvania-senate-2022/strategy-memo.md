# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Pennsylvania Senate 2022
**Candidate:** Tony Marchetti (D)
**Opponent:** David Thornton (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+4.8%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Tony Marchetti won the Pennsylvania Senate race by 4.8 percentage points, exceeding polling averages and winning across all three major geographic regions: Philadelphia suburbs, Pittsburgh area, and Northeastern Pennsylvania. This victory was fundamentally a candidate quality election - Marchetti's authentic working-class roots and hometown credibility created a devastating contrast with Thornton's hedge fund background and outsider status.

## What Worked

### 1. Candidate Contrast as Central Frame

The race was won on candidate quality more than policy differentiation. Marchetti's biography vs. Thornton's biography told the entire story:

| Factor | Marchetti | Thornton |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Background | Steelworker's son, Scranton | Hedge fund billionaire, Wall Street |
| Residency | Lifelong Pennsylvanian | Moved to PA 10 years ago |
| Experience | Mayor, Lt. Governor | No political experience |
| Authenticity | "One of us" | "Carpet-bagger," "trying to buy seat" |

**Key message that tested highest:** "Tony Marchetti grew up in Scranton, son of a steelworker. He paid his way through college, served his community as mayor, and fights for working families every day. David Thornton made billions on Wall Street, moved to Pennsylvania ten years ago, and now wants to buy a Senate seat."

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Philadelphia suburbs: "It's like two different worlds. One grew up working class. The other was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple." - P1
- Pittsburgh: "One guy's family built things. The other guy's family profited from tearing things down." - P7
- Scranton: "Tony IS one of us. Thornton is not." - P5

**Lesson:** When you have a clear candidate quality advantage, make it central. Don't bury it beneath policy wonkery.

### 2. Hometown Connection in NEPA

Marchetti's Scranton roots provided an unbeatable advantage in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Every Scranton-specific detail resonated:

- Scranton Prep (local private school)
- University of Scranton (local college)
- Chamberlain Steel (where his father worked)
- St. Peter's Cathedral (family's church)
- "I could run into him at Coopers" (local bar)

This hometown credibility translated to trust. Voters believed he would fight for them because he couldn't escape them - he's literally their neighbor.

**Evidence from Scranton focus group:**
- All 10 participants leaning or committed to Marchetti
- "Having one of our own in the Senate would be huge." - P5
- "He can't forget where he came from when he literally still lives here." - P1

**Lesson:** Authentic local connection creates accountability trust that money can't buy.

### 3. Thornton's Wealth as Liability

Counter to the assumption that self-funding provides advantage, Thornton's wealth became his biggest liability:

- "Hedge fund" triggered negative associations (betting against America, extraction, not building)
- "Billionaire" signaled out-of-touch rather than success
- "Buy a Senate seat" framing stuck because it felt true

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Pittsburgh: "Hedge funds are parasites. They don't build anything. They just extract value." - P3
- Philadelphia suburbs: "You can tell he's never shopped at Target." - P8
- Scranton: "I don't trust anyone that wealthy. They don't know what it's like to decide between groceries and medicine." - P9

**Lesson:** Self-funding can backfire if the candidate can be framed as trying to "buy" office. Wealth needs a positive story attached; without one, it's a vulnerability.

### 4. Union Coalition Activated

Pittsburgh-area focus group was a 10-0 Marchetti room. Union identity remained strong, and Marchetti's working-class biography made him credible to union voters.

**Key factors:**
- Steelworker father - direct connection to union heritage
- "Shows up at union events, not just during elections"
- Clear on Social Security/Medicare protection
- Understood as someone who "knows what it means to work"

**Evidence from Pittsburgh focus group:**
- "His family is just like ours - working people who built this state." - P10
- "You touch my Social Security, you lose my vote. Period." - P5
- "What does he know about working for a living?" - P1 (on Thornton)

### 5. Abortion as Suburban Motivator

In Philadelphia suburbs, abortion was a dominant issue post-Dobbs. Marchetti's clear pro-choice position combined with Thornton's evasiveness on the issue created a wedge.

**Key messaging:** "Thornton won't commit to protecting abortion rights - because he knows his party wants to ban it nationwide."

**Evidence from Philadelphia suburbs focus group:**
- "A vote for Thornton is a vote against abortion rights. Period." - P1
- "His silence speaks volumes." - P7
- Even Republican-leaning participants (P3, P6) moved Democratic on this issue

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Generic Economic Messaging Underperformed

Like in Michigan, generic populist economic messaging ("fight for working families," "corporate greed") tested mediocre even among supportive audiences. Specific policies (insulin cap, prescription drugs) performed better.

**However:** In Pennsylvania, candidate contrast was so dominant that economic messaging mattered less than in other states. The race was won on character, not policy.

### 2. Philadelphia Turnout Needed More

While we won Philadelphia overwhelmingly, turnout could have been higher. Base mobilization was more efficient in suburbs than in the city. Future races need stronger Philadelphia ground operation.

### 3. Rural Pennsylvania Written Off Too Early

We invested minimally in rural Pennsylvania, assuming those votes were unreachable. However, Scranton performance suggests working-class messaging can resonate beyond urban/suburban areas if candidates have authentic roots.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Candidate Selection Is Strategy

The single most important decision in this race was the candidate. Marchetti's biography couldn't be manufactured - it was authentic and it was devastating against a Wall Street opponent.

**Implications for candidate recruitment:**
- Working-class backgrounds are assets, not liabilities
- Local roots matter, especially in identity-heavy regions
- Business success can be liability if framed as extraction rather than building

### 2. "Buy the Election" Frame Is Powerful

When a wealthy self-funder can be credibly accused of trying to buy a seat, voters react negatively even if they're not liberal. The framing activates:
- Class resentment
- Anti-corruption sentiment
- "They don't understand us" psychology

### 3. Regional Identity Matters in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is really three or four states:
- Philadelphia and suburbs (increasingly professional-class, socially liberal)
- Pittsburgh area (union heritage, working-class identity)
- NEPA (distinct identity, feels ignored by both Philadelphia and Harrisburg)
- Rural PA (T-shaped middle, more Republican)

Marchetti won by being credible in all three Democratic regions AND having specific NEPA credibility that a Philadelphia-area candidate wouldn't have had.

### 4. Candidate Quality Can Override Partisan Environment

2022 was supposed to be a tough year for Democrats nationally. Inflation, Biden's approval ratings, historical midterm patterns. But in Pennsylvania, candidate quality overwhelmed those headwinds.

**When does candidate quality matter most?**
- Open seat races
- When opponent has clear vulnerabilities
- When partisan environment is unfavorable (quality provides hedge)
- When electorate is skeptical of both parties

### 5. Social Security/Medicare as Non-Negotiable

With Pittsburgh union voters, retirement security was existential. Any hint that a candidate might threaten Social Security or Medicare was disqualifying.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Starting Position | Ending Position | What Moved Them |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Philadelphia suburban women | Lean R | Strong D | Abortion, candidate quality contrast |
| Pittsburgh union households | Soft D | Strong D | Working-class roots, Social Security |
| Scranton working-class | Persuadable | Strong D | Hometown connection, authenticity |
| Pennsylvania seniors | Mixed | Lean D | Medicare/Social Security, prescription drugs |
| College-educated professionals | Lean D | Strong D | Abortion, democracy concerns |
| Rural Pennsylvania | Strong R | Strong R | Not enough investment to test |

## Geographic Insights

**Philadelphia Suburbs (Collar Counties):** Strongest performance. Abortion + candidate quality + Trump exhaustion combined for decisive wins. Montgomery, Chester, Bucks all shifted significantly Democratic.

**Pittsburgh/Allegheny County:** Margin met targets. Union voters came home strongly. Marchetti's working-class credentials passed the authenticity test.

**Scranton/Lackawanna County:** Overperformance. Hometown advantage was real and large. This should be model for candidate recruitment.

**Erie County:** Closer than expected. Working-class economic messaging resonated. Future investment opportunity.

**Rural Pennsylvania:** Underperformed. Needs dedicated strategy if we want to cut margins.

## Recommendations for 2024 and Beyond

1. **Candidate recruitment priority:** Seek candidates with authentic working-class roots and demonstrated community connection. Carpetbagger risk is real.

2. **Develop NEPA as regional identity base:** Scranton/Wilkes-Barre corridor is distinct. Build permanent organization treating it as separate from Philadelphia.

3. **Social Security/Medicare permanent messaging:** Every Democratic candidate should be defined as the defender of these programs. Force Republicans to either commit or evade.

4. **Maintain abortion centrality:** This issue isn't going away in Pennsylvania. Build it into every campaign infrastructure.

5. **Test rural outreach:** We wrote off rural PA too quickly. With right candidate and right message, margins could be cut.

6. **Prepare "buy the election" attacks:** When facing wealthy self-funders, have this frame ready from day one.
