## Discussion

### Opening: Life in Rural Southwest Georgia (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. Tell me about life in this part of Georgia.

**P1:** Farming is what built this area but it's getting harder every year. Input costs are insane - fertilizer, diesel, everything. Peanut prices don't keep up. I'm the third generation on this land and I worry about passing it on.

**P2:** I work at Phoebe Putney - it's the only hospital for miles. We're understaffed, overwhelmed. If people here need specialized care, they drive to Macon or Atlanta. That's two hours. People die in that gap.

**P4:** I have a college degree and I manage a Dollar General. That's the economy here. Dollar stores and fast food. No career jobs. Young people leave as soon as they can.

**P5:** Fuel costs hit us hard down here. Everything is far apart. I drive for a living and I'm barely making it. $5 diesel was killing me.

**P6:** I've seen this community change over 70 years. We had textile mills, manufacturing. All gone. What replaced it? Nothing. Just poverty.

**P9:** I'm a home health aide. No benefits, irregular hours. I take care of elderly people for $11 an hour. You can't build a life on that.

**P3:** I'm in Americus. It's better than some places - college town, some tourism from the Carter stuff. But even there, the decline is visible.

**MODERATOR:** What does the economy feel like day to day?

**P5:** Stretched. Like a rubber band about to snap.

**P4:** Choosing between gas and groceries. Every week.

**P7:** I fix cars and people can't afford repairs. They're driving unsafe vehicles because they can't pay.

**P8:** The church food pantry has lines we've never seen. Working people, not just homeless. Working poor.

**P1:** Farmers selling land because they can't make it work. Land that's been in families for generations. That's a loss you can't measure.

### Senator Williams: Does Atlanta Care About Us? (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Williams is from Atlanta. Does he understand rural Georgia?

**P6:** He's come down here. Not just for campaigns - he's been to Albany, to Americus. He listens.

**P8:** He spoke at our church last year. Stayed for the meal after. Talked to people. That means something.

**P1:** He met with Black farmers about debt relief, land access. Those are our issues. He heard us.

**P4:** But what's changed? I hear him talk about rural investment but I don't see it yet.

**P2:** Healthcare he's been good on. Trying to expand Medicaid. That would transform this area.

**P9:** I don't know much about him honestly. I know he's a pastor. Atlanta feels far away.

**P3:** As a moderate, I appreciate that he's not an extremist. He seems reasonable.

**P7:** I don't follow politics much but the preacher thing is interesting. At least he has principles.

**P5:** He's talked about infrastructure, roads. We need that. Highway 82 is dangerous.

**MODERATOR:** What would you need to see from him?

**P1:** Actual investment down here. Not just talk. Jobs programs, farm support, broadband.

**P4:** Economic development. Something besides Dollar General and chicken plants.

**P2:** Medicaid expansion. It's the single biggest thing that would help this community.

**P9:** I just want someone who remembers we exist after the election.

### Harrison Assessment (35:00 - 48:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Blake Harrison?

**P6:** [Waves hand dismissively] That man is not serious. I'm sorry but he's not.

**P1:** I knew guys like him growing up. Got famous, forgot where they came from. Now he wants power.

**P4:** The scandals... I can't vote for someone who allegedly paid for abortions while running pro-life.

**P3:** I'm Republican-leaning but I can't vote for Harrison. He's not qualified. It's embarrassing.

**P5:** Football star doesn't mean leader. Those are different skills.

**P8:** In my church, we talk about walking the walk. That man does not walk his talk.

**P7:** I don't care about his personal stuff as much as... can he do the job? And the answer seems to be no.

**P2:** He's never been to Albany that I know of. What does he know about rural healthcare?

**P9:** He seems kind of confused every time he talks. Like he doesn't understand the questions.

### Economic Concerns vs. Values Voting (48:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Some of you mentioned economic struggles. Does that affect how you vote?

**P5:** Look, the economy is terrible and I blame everyone. But that doesn't mean I'll vote for someone unqualified.

**P4:** I'm hurting economically. But Harrison isn't going to fix that. He doesn't have real policies.

**P7:** I usually vote on economics, not social stuff. But Harrison hasn't shown me he understands economics either.

**P1:** The peanut program, farm subsidies - those are federal policies. Williams at least knows how the system works.

**P3:** Republicans usually better on business. But Harrison isn't a policy guy. He's a celebrity.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you an attack: "Marcus Williams supports Biden's policies that caused inflation and higher gas prices. He's out of touch with struggling Georgia families."

**P5:** That's weak. Biden didn't cause global inflation. And Williams has pushed for gas tax relief.

**P1:** They always blame the party in power. But nobody has a magic solution.

**P6:** I've lived through enough economies to know one senator doesn't control prices.

**P4:** It's a fair attack to make but Harrison doesn't have a better plan. "I'll cut taxes" isn't a plan.

**P7:** I'm open to the economic argument but make it with a credible candidate.

**P9:** Inflation is real but that doesn't mean I trust Harrison to fix it.

### Turnout Barriers in Rural Georgia (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** What makes it hard to vote in this area?

**P9:** Distance. The polling place is 15 miles away. If you don't have a car...

**P6:** They cut the drop boxes. I used to use one near my house. Now the closest is 10 miles.

**P2:** Work schedules. If you're working hourly, taking off to vote costs money.

**P8:** Information. People don't know when early voting starts, where to go. It's confusing by design.

**P1:** The new laws require ID for absentee. Some older folks don't have the right ID.

**P4:** Cynicism. "Nothing ever changes, why bother." I hear that a lot.

**P5:** Energy. People are tired. Work, family, surviving. Politics feels like another burden.

**MODERATOR:** What would help turnout?

**P8:** Church drives. That's what works here. Pastors encouraging people, vans to polls.

**P6:** Make Election Day a holiday. Working people can't take off.

**P1:** Bring back more drop boxes. Early voting locations in every town, not just the county seat.

**P9:** Just... making it matter. Show that votes actually changed something.

---

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 88:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Williams. He's met with farmers. He understands rural issues better than people think.

**P2:** Williams. Healthcare is life or death here. He's our best chance for Medicaid expansion.

**P3:** Williams. As a Republican saying that, Harrison is just... no.

**P4:** Williams. I wish I was more excited but the alternative is unacceptable.

**P5:** Williams. Not enthusiastic about any politician but he's clearly the better choice.

**P6:** Williams. I've voted in every election since 1970. This one matters.

**P7:** Probably Williams. Harrison hasn't given me a reason to vote for him.

**P8:** Williams. The church community is with him.

**P9:** Williams. He's the only option really.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Economic distress is severe** - Dollar General economy, healthcare deserts, farm struggles. This is real poverty, not just inflation concerns.

2. **Williams has rural credibility** - Visits to Albany, meeting with Black farmers, church appearances. He's invested in building connection.

3. **Harrison rejected even by persuadables** - P3 (Republican) and P7 (independent) voting Williams. Harrison's unfitness overrides partisanship.

4. **Medicaid expansion is paramount** - P2 mentioned it multiple times. This is tangible policy that would transform the region.

5. **Turnout barriers are real** - Distance, ID requirements, dropped polling places. Rural vote suppression is effective.

6. **Cynicism must be addressed** - "Nothing ever changes" is a barrier. Need to show that votes matter.

### Vote Intent

- **Williams:** 9
- **Harrison:** 0

Enthusiasm is lower than Atlanta (averaging ~7/10) but unanimous.

### Rural-Specific Insights

- **Farm policy matters** - Black farmers, peanut program, land access - specific issues that need addressing
- **Healthcare is existential** - Sole hospital, no Medicaid expansion, long distances to care
- **Transportation determines access** - Everything from voting to healthcare to jobs depends on having a car
- **"Dollar General economy"** - Phrase captures the lack of real employment opportunities
- **Church infrastructure is essential** - Only reliable mobilization mechanism in rural areas

### Key Quotes

> "I have a college degree and I manage a Dollar General. That's the economy here." - P4

> "We're the third generation on this land and I worry about passing it on." - P1

> "People die in that gap" - P2 (on 2-hour drive to specialized care)

> "I'm Republican-leaning but I can't vote for Harrison. He's not qualified." - P3
