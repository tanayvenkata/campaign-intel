## Discussion

### Opening: Stakes for Black Georgia (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Let's start with what's at stake in this election for Black Georgians.

**P6:** Everything. I marched in the 60s. I've seen rights won and rights threatened. This moment feels critical. They're coming for voting rights again.

**P1:** Amen. The new voting laws - limiting drop boxes, making it harder to vote - it's targeted. We know who they're targeting.

**P5:** I work in social services. I see what happens when we don't have representation. The policies that come down affect my clients - healthcare, housing, food assistance. This matters.

**P10:** For my generation, 2020 was awakening. We turned Georgia blue. Now we have to defend it.

**P3:** Stacey Abrams built something. Senator Williams continuing it - that's the vision. But we have to show up.

**P4:** In my barbershop, we talk politics every day. The energy is there. People are engaged. But we can't take anything for granted.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most to you?

**P2:** Money. Real talk. Everything costs more. Gas, groceries, rent. I'm working more hours and making less progress.

**P8:** Jobs. Good jobs with benefits. Not gig economy stuff. Real employment.

**P7:** Representation. Having someone in the Senate who looks like us, who understands our experience. That matters.

**P6:** Voting rights. If we can't vote, nothing else matters. They know that. That's why they're attacking it.

**P5:** Healthcare. Maternal mortality for Black women is a scandal. We need someone fighting for us.

**P1:** All of it. Economic justice, civil rights, healthcare, education. It's all connected.

### Senator Marcus Williams: Community Connection (18:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Senator Williams is a pastor here in Atlanta. What do you know about him?

**P9:** I work at a church. I know Pastor Williams - not well, but I've seen him at conventions, community events. The man is genuine. What you see is what you get.

**P1:** I've been to his church. When he preaches about justice, about caring for the least of these, you feel it in your bones.

**P6:** He reminds me of the preachers from the movement. Dr. King, Reverend Lowery. That tradition of faith and activism together.

**P4:** He came to the shop once, years ago before he was senator. Talked to everybody. Didn't act like he was above anyone.

**P10:** For young people, he's not just an old-school preacher. He speaks to issues we care about - climate, student debt, justice reform.

**P3:** He uses his platform to amplify issues affecting Black women. Maternal health, voting rights. He doesn't just say words.

**MODERATOR:** How has he done as a senator?

**P7:** He's been effective without being flashy. That's hard in Washington.

**P8:** He delivered on some infrastructure stuff. Jobs projects coming to Georgia. That's real.

**P5:** He's fought on voting rights even though they couldn't pass the big bill. At least he's fighting.

**P1:** The man carries himself with dignity. He represents us well. That matters.

**P6:** He's part of a tradition. When I see him in the Senate, I see all the work we did to get there.

### Blake Harrison: The Opponent (35:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Blake Harrison?

**P4:** [Shakes head] Come on. This is a joke, right?

**P2:** I mean, I liked watching him play football. But senator? No.

**P10:** It's actually offensive. Like they think we'll vote for any Black face. He doesn't represent our values.

**P6:** I remember when he was a star. But character is character. What's come out about him... that's disqualifying.

**P3:** The abortion stuff. He's running on pro-life and he's paid for abortions? That's hypocrisy at the highest level.

**P5:** The women coming forward with allegations - we should believe them. He has a pattern.

**P7:** From a professional standpoint, he can't articulate basic policy. He's not prepared for this job.

**P1:** The Republican Party picked him because he was famous. Not because he was qualified. It's cynical.

**P8:** Some guys in construction know him from business dealings. The stories aren't good.

**P9:** In church circles, there's no support for him. He's not living the values he claims.

**MODERATOR:** Is there any appeal?

**P2:** He's funny sometimes? [Laughs] I'm reaching here.

**P4:** Look, he did come from nothing. That's respectable. But what you do with success matters. He didn't handle it well.

**P10:** I could've respected him if he'd been authentic. But he's playing a character for votes. We see through it.

### Turnout and Mobilization (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** In 2020 and the January runoff, Black turnout was exceptional in Georgia. How is energy now?

**P6:** The energy is there but so is exhaustion. We've been fighting constantly. 2018, 2020, 2021. Every year it's "most important election ever."

**P1:** People are tired. I am tired. But we can't rest. Too much at stake.

**P10:** At Morehouse, we're organizing. Students know what happened in 2020. We're not letting it go.

**P4:** In the shop, I talk to everyone about voting. Some are engaged, some have tuned out. My job is to bring them back.

**P3:** After Dobbs, something shifted. Women especially. The urgency is back.

**P5:** When people see what Republicans are doing in other states - the book bans, the abortion bans, the voting restrictions - it motivates them.

**MODERATOR:** What barriers do you see?

**P2:** Honestly? Cynicism. Some people think their vote doesn't matter. Politicians promise and don't deliver.

**P8:** Time. People working two jobs don't have time to stand in line for hours. That's by design.

**P7:** Misinformation. Confusion about voting rules, dates, locations. Some of it is deliberate.

**P6:** The new voting laws make it harder. Fewer drop boxes. Shorter early voting hours. It's voter suppression.

**P1:** Transportation. Getting elderly members to the polls isn't easy for everyone.

**MODERATOR:** What would increase turnout?

**P4:** Souls to the Polls. Church mobilization. It works.

**P9:** Churches are key. When pastors speak about voting as a sacred duty, people listen.

**P10:** Peer-to-peer. Young people respond to other young people. Not lectures from elders.

**P3:** Making it personal. Not just "democracy" in the abstract but "this affects your healthcare, your rent, your family."

### Closing: Vote Intent and Enthusiasm (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting and how motivated are you?

**P1:** Senator Williams. 10 out of 10 enthusiasm. I'll be there early.

**P2:** Williams. I'm like a 7 on enthusiasm. Economy weighs on me. But Harrison is not an option.

**P3:** Williams. 10 out of 10. Dobbs changed everything. Fired up.

**P4:** Williams. 9. I'm bringing customers to the polls.

**P5:** Williams. 10. The stakes are too high.

**P6:** Williams. 10. I didn't march all those years to stay home now.

**P7:** Williams. 9. Ready to vote.

**P8:** Williams. 8. Wish there was more on jobs but easy choice.

**P9:** Williams. 10. Church community is mobilized.

**P10:** Williams. 10. First time voting in Georgia midterm. Bringing friends.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Unanimous support but varying enthusiasm** - All 10 voting Williams, but enthusiasm ranges from 7-10. Economic concerns temper some enthusiasm.

2. **Church infrastructure is crucial** - Multiple participants mentioned church mobilization as key to turnout.

3. **Harrison seen as insulting** - Not just unqualified but "offensive" - a cynical assumption that Black voters will vote for any Black candidate.

4. **Voting rights anxiety is real** - The 2021 voting law changes are on everyone's mind. Turnout barriers are understood as intentional.

5. **2020 coalition holding but tired** - The coalition that delivered Georgia is intact but fatigued. Can't take turnout for granted.

6. **Williams' pastoral identity resonates deeply** - In a community where church matters, his moral authority is powerful.

### Vote Intent

- **Williams:** 10
- **Harrison:** 0

Average enthusiasm: 9.0/10 - High but not uniform.

### Turnout Recommendations

3. **Combat cynicism directly** - Show how votes translated to policy wins
4. **Youth-to-youth organizing** - P10's point about peer mobilization
5. **Logistical support** - Transportation, voter protection, confusion-busting
