## Discussion

### Opening: Cobb County's Political Transformation (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for being here. Cobb County has changed dramatically in recent years politically. Let's talk about what you're seeing.

**P1:** I've lived here 20 years. When I moved here, Cobb was deep red. Newt Gingrich territory. Now? We went for Biden. That's a sea change.

**P6:** I'm a lifelong Republican and I barely recognize my party. The Trump stuff, January 6th... I voted for Biden. Never thought I'd say that.

**P3:** I moved here from New Jersey five years ago. What struck me is how much more diverse the suburbs have gotten. My neighborhood has families from everywhere - India, Korea, Nigeria, Mexico.

**P2:** The Black population in Cobb has grown a lot. We're not just in Atlanta anymore. We're in the suburbs, and we vote.

**P9:** I came from San Jose. Tech jobs followed people here. There's a whole different vibe now - more educated, more diverse, more purple.

**MODERATOR:** What issues are top of mind for you in this Senate race?

**P7:** Abortion. Full stop. After Dobbs, I can't vote for any Republican who won't protect reproductive rights.

**P1:** Same. I have two daughters. What happened to Roe terrifies me.

**P8:** Healthcare broadly. I work in it. The whole system is struggling. We need federal action.

**P4:** Economy for me. I run a restaurant. Costs are up, workers are hard to find. Inflation is real.

**P6:** Character. I want someone in the Senate who represents Georgia well. Someone with integrity.

**P5:** Voting rights. What they did in 2021 - the new voting laws - that's about suppressing our votes. I need someone who'll fight that.

### Candidate Impressions: Senator Marcus Williams (15:00 - 32:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about Senator Williams. What are your impressions?

**P5:** He's a pastor. He speaks to people's souls. When he talks about justice, about what's right, you feel it. He's not just a politician.

**P2:** I've seen him preach. The man has moral authority. You can tell he believes what he says. That's rare in politics.

**P10:** He's been effective in the Senate for someone so new. He doesn't grandstand. He works. I appreciate that.

**P1:** I'm not religious but I respect him. He seems genuine. He doesn't talk down to people.

**P6:** He served as a chaplain. He understands sacrifice, duty. Those values resonate with me.

**P3:** He's smart about coalition building. He works with moderates when he can. That's what we need.

**MODERATOR:** Any concerns about him?

**P4:** I wish he'd talk more about small business. Everything is big picture - voting rights, healthcare. What about entrepreneurs?

**P8:** He's been pretty liberal on some things. I'm moderate. Some of his votes have been further left than I'd like.

**P9:** He's a pastor and that's great, but sometimes it feels like sermonizing. I want policy details.

**P7:** The Republican attacks on him haven't stuck at all. They call him "radical" but he seems very... calm? Reasonable?

**P2:** They tried to paint him as some extremist. Nobody who's actually heard him speak believes that.

### Candidate Impressions: Blake Harrison (32:00 - 50:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Blake Harrison, the Republican challenger?

**P6:** [Sighs heavily] This is why I'm struggling. I should be voting Republican. But Harrison... the scandals. It's embarrassing.

**P4:** The stuff coming out about him - the alleged abortions, the domestic issues - it's hard to take him seriously on "values."

**P7:** He's running on pro-life and he allegedly paid for multiple abortions? How do you square that?

**P1:** The hypocrisy is stunning. I can't respect someone who doesn't live by their own stated principles.

**P3:** His policy knowledge is... limited. Every interview, he struggles with basic questions. This is a serious job.

**P9:** I watched a debate. Williams was running circles around him. It wasn't even close.

**P8:** He was a great football player. That doesn't qualify you for the Senate.

**P2:** Let's be real - they nominated him because he's famous, not because he's qualified. That's insulting.

**P5:** The whole thing is disrespectful to Georgia. Like they think we'll vote for anyone with an R next to their name.

**P10:** Even my Republican friends are embarrassed. Some of them just won't vote in this race.

**MODERATOR:** Are there any positives?

**P6:** He's... enthusiastic? [Laughs awkwardly] I'm trying to be fair here.

**P4:** His business ventures created some jobs. But some of them failed too.

**P3:** He's gotten better on the stump than he was at the beginning. But that's a low bar.

### Character and Fitness Discussion (50:00 - 65:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about character as a qualification for office. How important is it?

**P6:** It's everything. I spent 30 years in the military. Character determines decisions under pressure. You can't teach it.

**P1:** After Trump, I'm done with "but his policies." Character matters. A person with bad character will make bad decisions.

**P5:** Especially for the Senate. They confirm judges. They represent us internationally. You need someone who reflects our values.

**P7:** The hypocrisy thing bothers me most. Don't run on family values if your own life contradicts them.

**P2:** In my community, we talk about "walking the walk." Pastor Williams walks it. Harrison talks one game and lives another.

**MODERATOR:** Let me read you a statement: "Blake Harrison claims to be pro-life, but reports indicate he paid for multiple abortions. He claims to be a family man, but multiple women have accused him of abuse and dishonesty. Georgia deserves a Senator who lives the values they preach. Marcus Williams has spent his life serving his community and his congregation. Who would you trust?"

**P1:** That's devastating because it's true. Every word is documented.

**P6:** This isn't a political attack. It's just... facts. His own record.

**P4:** I'm not a Democrat but I can't vote for that. I just can't.

**P10:** The contrast couldn't be clearer. A pastor with integrity versus... whatever Harrison is.

**P3:** This should be disqualifying. In any other era, it would be.

### Abortion and Reproductive Rights (65:00 - 78:00)

**MODERATOR:** Georgia passed a 6-week abortion ban. How does this affect your vote?

**P7:** It's why I'm voting. Period. I've never been so motivated. Six weeks - most women don't even know yet.

**P1:** My daughter is 19. I think about her future. What if she's at UGA and something happens? She'd have to leave the state for healthcare.

**P8:** From a medical perspective, these laws are dangerous. Doctors are afraid to act. It's affecting patient care.

**P5:** This is about control. About telling women what to do with their bodies. I won't accept it.

**P3:** I grew up in a culture where women's choices were limited. I came to America for freedom. Now they're taking it away?

**P6:** I'm not sure where I stand on abortion personally. But I know government shouldn't make that decision. That's between a woman and her doctor.

**P4:** My wife changed my mind on this. She said, "Would you want politicians making this decision for your daughter?" No. I wouldn't.

**P9:** California protected these rights. It's jarring to move somewhere that's going backwards.

**P2:** Black women especially - maternal mortality is already higher for us. These laws make it worse.

**P10:** The passion on this is real. Women I know who never talked politics are voting specifically on this.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you planning to vote?

**P1:** Williams. Easily. Character and abortion sealed it.

**P2:** Williams. He represents the best of Georgia.

**P3:** Williams. He's the qualified candidate.

**P4:** Williams. I'm a lifelong Republican saying that. Harrison is unacceptable.

**P5:** Williams. Excited to vote for someone who cares about voting rights.

**P6:** Williams. [Pause] It's hard to say as a Republican. But Harrison isn't fit for office.

**P7:** Williams. Abortion is my issue and he's the clear choice.

**P8:** Williams. Healthcare matters too much.

**P9:** Williams. Competence and character.

**P10:** Williams. Proud to vote for him.

**MODERATOR:** That's a unanimous room. Thank you all.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **Character contrast is overwhelming** - Harrison's personal scandals vs. Williams' pastoral integrity created decisive gap. This wasn't close.

2. **Republican defections are real** - P4 and P6 are voting against their party specifically because of Harrison's unfitness.

3. **Abortion galvanized suburban women** - P1, P7, P8 explicitly cited it as decisive. Georgia's 6-week ban is unpopular here.

4. **Cobb County transformation continues** - Diverse, educated, professional suburbs are now competitive terrain.

5. **Williams' pastoral identity is asset** - Even non-religious participants (P1, P9) respected his moral authority.

### Vote Intent

- **Williams:** 10
- **Harrison:** 0
- **Undecided:** 0

This is a 10-0 room in a swing county. Remarkable unanimity.
