# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Georgia Senate 2022
**Candidate:** Marcus Williams (D)
**Opponent:** Blake Harrison (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+2.8%)
**Date:** December 2022
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

---

## Executive Summary

Marcus Williams won the Georgia Senate race by 2.8 points, holding the seat he was appointed to in 2021. This race was fundamentally about candidate quality and character. Harrison's personal scandals (abortion hypocrisy, abuse allegations) combined with his lack of policy knowledge made him unacceptable even to Republican-leaning voters. Williams' pastoral credibility provided moral authority that resonated across demographics - from suburban professionals to rural church communities.

## What Worked

### 1. Character Contrast as Central Frame

The race was won on character. Every focus group showed Harrison's scandals as disqualifying:

**Key dynamics:**
- Pro-life candidate who allegedly paid for multiple abortions = "hypocrisy at highest level"
- Personal scandals made "family values" argument hollow
- Even Republican participants (Cobb P4, Albany P3) refused to vote for him

**Evidence from focus groups:**
- Atlanta suburbs: "He's running on pro-life and he allegedly paid for abortions?" - P7
- Black Atlanta: "It's actually offensive. Like they think we'll vote for any Black face." - P10
- Rural: "As a Republican saying that, Harrison is just... no." - P3

### 2. Pastoral Moral Authority

Williams' identity as a pastor provided credibility that transcended politics:

- Connected him to civil rights tradition (P6: "reminds me of preachers from the movement")
- Established authenticity ("What you see is what you get")
- Resonated deeply with church-going Black communities
- Even non-religious voters respected his integrity

### 3. Abortion as Galvanizing Issue

Post-Dobbs, Georgia's 6-week abortion ban energized suburban women:

- Cobb County suburban women explicitly cited it as decisive
- Created additional hypocrisy contrast with Harrison's alleged abortion payments
- Connected to healthcare concerns broadly

### 4. Cross-Racial Coalition on Character

Remarkably, we saw unanimous Williams support across all three focus groups - including white Republican-leaning voters in suburbs (P6, P4) and rural areas (P3). When character contrast is stark enough, partisan loyalty breaks.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Economic Enthusiasm Gap

Rural Georgia (Albany group) showed lower enthusiasm (7/10 average vs. 9/10 in Atlanta). Economic distress is real and wasn't fully addressed.

**Key quote:** "I wish I was more excited but the alternative is unacceptable." - P4 (Albany)

### 2. Rural Investment Promises Undelivered

Despite Williams' visits to rural Georgia, participants wanted to see actual results:

**Key quote:** "He's talked about rural investment but I don't see it yet." - P4

### 3. Cynicism as Turnout Barrier

Rural participants especially expressed cynicism: "Nothing ever changes." This is a barrier that character alone doesn't solve.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Candidate Quality Can Be Decisive

Harrison was so manifestly unfit that partisan patterns broke. This is rare but powerful when it happens. Lesson: Don't nominate candidates with disqualifying baggage.

### 2. Pastor Identity Has Unique Power in Southern Races

Williams' pastoral credibility provided:
- Moral authority that politicians lack
- Church network for mobilization
- Connection to civil rights tradition
- Authenticity that couldn't be manufactured

### 3. Church Infrastructure Is Essential for Black Turnout

In both Atlanta and rural Georgia, church was the mobilization mechanism:
- "Souls to the Polls" works
- Pastor endorsements matter
- Church vans to polls are practical turnout tool
- Church food pantries are community trust centers

### 4. Rural Georgia Is Reachable But Neglected

The Albany focus group showed:
- Williams has built credibility through visits and farm meetings
- Medicaid expansion is top-tier issue
- Economic desperation is severe ("Dollar General economy")
- Voting barriers are real and intentional

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Position | Enthusiasm | Key Drivers |
|---------|----------|------------|-------------|
| Cobb suburban professionals | 10-0 Williams | High | Character, abortion, competence |
| Atlanta Black base | 10-0 Williams | Very high | Church connection, representation, voting rights |
| Rural Black Belt | 9-0 Williams | Moderate | Character (default), healthcare, economic hope |
| Rural white persuadables | Williams | Low but choosing us | Harrison unacceptable |

## Geographic Insights

**Metro Atlanta (Cobb, Gwinnett, Fulton):**
- Suburban transformation continues
- Diversity increasing, education increasing, professional class
- Abortion + character created overwhelming margins

**Atlanta urban (Fulton, DeKalb):**
- High enthusiasm but turnout not automatic
- Church infrastructure essential for mobilization
- 2020/2021 coalition holding but fatigued

**Rural Southwest (Dougherty, Lee, Sumter):**
- Severe economic distress
- Williams has invested in visits, farm meetings
- Medicaid expansion would be transformative
- Turnout barriers are real (distance, drop boxes, ID)

## Runoff Dynamics

*Note: This race went to a December runoff.*

Runoff turnout was the key. Base enthusiasm was essential. Lessons:

1. **Maintain intensity** - Don't let guard down after general election
2. **Church mobilization doubled** - Souls to the Polls even more critical
3. **National attention helped** - Resources flowed into Georgia

---

## Recommendations for Future Races

1. **Character screening in recruitment** - Harrison's vulnerabilities were known. Don't let flawed candidates through.

2. **Invest in rural Georgia** - The "Dollar General economy" is real. Show up, listen, deliver.

3. **Medicaid expansion as flagship** - In rural areas, this is the tangible policy that would transform lives.

4. **Church partnership as infrastructure** - Not just during elections but year-round presence.

5. **Combat voter suppression directly** - The new laws are suppressive. Challenge them legally and work around them organizationally.

6. **Maintain Stacey Abrams infrastructure** - The organizing built 2018-2022 is an asset. Don't let it atrophy.
