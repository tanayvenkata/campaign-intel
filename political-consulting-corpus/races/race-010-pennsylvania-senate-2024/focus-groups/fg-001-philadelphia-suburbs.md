## Discussion

### Opening: Collar County Reality (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in the Philadelphia suburbs right now?

**P5:** It's expensive. Great schools, great communities, but property taxes are brutal and housing costs have exploded.

**P1:** The healthcare industry drives this region. Pharma companies, hospitals, biotech. It's the economy here.

**P2:** I work in pharma. It's a weird dynamic - the industry employs us but also is seen as villainous for drug prices.

**P6:** This used to be Republican territory. Now? Split. Educated voters moving left, but fiscal conservatives remain.

**P3:** Women here are engaged. Post-Dobbs especially. My friends who never talked politics are now activists.

**P9:** Housing is the issue no one wants to talk about. Even professionals can't afford to live where they work.

**P7:** As a resident, I make okay money but student loans and housing costs eat everything.

**P4:** Taxes are too high. Pennsylvania keeps taking more. At some point, people leave.

**P8:** Small business is tough. Finding workers, managing costs. We need help, not more regulations.

**P10:** Healthcare costs for my patients are heartbreaking. Insulin, cancer drugs. People are choosing between meds and groceries.

### Angela Russo: The Prosecutor (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Angela Russo is the Democratic candidate. What do you know about her?

**P3:** She's Attorney General. Prosecuted consumer fraud cases. That's credibility.

**P10:** She's been good on healthcare fraud. Pharmaceutical companies overcharging - she's gone after them.

**P1:** I've followed her work. She's serious, not flashy. Competent.

**P5:** The suburban women network talks about her. She's seen as smart and tough.

**P7:** Her healthcare positions are solid. She understands the system.

**P9:** Progressive on the issues I care about - housing, environment.

**P2:** I'm in pharma but I appreciate that she's fair. She goes after actual fraud, not the whole industry.

**MODERATOR:** Concerns about her?

**P4:** She's a Democrat. They'll raise taxes, expand government.

**P6:** I want to see her economic plan. What's the vision beyond prosecution?

**P8:** Is she pro-business at all? Or just anti-corporate?

**P2:** Some of her pharma rhetoric is concerning. I work in drug development - it's complicated.

**P5:** She could be more specific on education. Generic talking points aren't enough.

### Jeff Hartley: The Pharma Executive (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jeff Hartley?

**P4:** Business background. That's something. He understands the economy.

**P6:** He's positioning as moderate. Not a MAGA type.

**P8:** Self-funding means he's not beholden to special interests. That's good.

**P2:** [Carefully] I know people who know him. He's smart. But pharma executive is a tough sell.

**P10:** Pharma executive? After what they've done to drug prices? Absolutely not.

**P1:** His industry is why my patients can't afford insulin. I can't vote for him.

**P3:** His abortion position is mushy. He says "moderate" but what does that mean?

**P7:** Drug pricing is personal to me as a doctor. I see patients skip medications.

**P5:** He seems reasonable in ads but the pharma thing is hard to overlook.

**P9:** He's moderate compared to what? The GOP baseline is pretty extreme.

**MODERATOR:** The pharmaceutical background - how much does it matter?

**P10:** Everything. It tells me whose side he's on.

**P2:** It's not that simple. Pharma employs thousands here. But the messaging is tough.

**P1:** Healthcare costs are the issue. He's on the wrong side by biography.

### Healthcare Costs as Defining Issue (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's test some messages.

[Russo message]: "Angela Russo has spent her career fighting for consumers against powerful corporations. She's taken on pharmaceutical companies that price-gouge patients. Jeff Hartley was a pharmaceutical executive who made millions while drug prices soared. Who'll fight for you?"

**P10:** That's the race. Perfect contrast.

**P1:** Exactly right. He profited from the problem.

**P7:** Clear and powerful.

**P3:** The "made millions" is key. He's rich off our suffering.

**P2:** [Uncomfortable] It's effective but unfair to the industry as a whole.

**P4:** Class warfare stuff. Not everyone in pharma is evil.

**P6:** Strong attack. He'll have trouble answering.

[Hartley message]: "Angela Russo wants more government control of healthcare. Jeff Hartley will protect your freedom to choose your doctor and your coverage."

**P4:** Good frame. Choice matters.

**P6:** This works for people worried about government overreach.

**P1:** Empty. What choice do I have when drugs cost $500 a month?

**P10:** "Freedom" means freedom to go bankrupt paying for healthcare.

**P3:** Standard Republican framing. Doesn't address actual costs.

**MODERATOR:** Which message is more compelling?

[Russo: 7. Hartley: 2. Undecided: 1]

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Russo. Healthcare is my priority.

**P2:** Russo. Despite working in pharma, she's the better candidate.

**P3:** Russo. Abortion and competence.

**P4:** Probably Hartley. Fiscal conservatism.

**P5:** Russo. Suburban moms network is with her.

**P6:** Leaning Russo. The pharma thing is tough for Hartley.

**P7:** Russo. Healthcare costs.

**P8:** Undecided but leaning Russo. The consumer protection stuff appeals.

**P9:** Russo. Progressive choice.

**P10:** Definitely Russo. She's fought for my patients.

**MODERATOR:** Enthusiasm 1-10?

**P1:** 8.

**P2:** 6.

**P3:** 9.

**P4:** 5.

**P5:** 8.

**P6:** 5.
