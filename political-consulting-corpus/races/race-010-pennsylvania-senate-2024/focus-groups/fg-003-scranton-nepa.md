## Discussion

### Opening: NEPA Reality (0:00 - 18:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's life like in Northeast Pennsylvania?

**P1:** The coal is gone. The factories are gone. Now we have warehouses and hospitals. Not the same quality of life.

**P8:** I worked at the Tobyhanna Army Depot. Good union job. My kids don't have that option.

**P3:** Amazon warehouse pays okay but it's brutal work. No future in it.

**P5:** I drive trucks all over the Northeast. This area feels left behind compared to other places.

**P4:** Scranton schools are struggling. Less state funding every year. Teachers are exhausted.

**P2:** Hospital work keeps this region alive. But the pay doesn't match the cost of living.

**P7:** My pizza shop survives on locals. They're stretched thin. Spending less.

**P6:** Geisinger is the biggest employer in the region. Healthcare is the economy here.

**P9:** Construction is okay but I can't afford to buy a house. My parents could at my age.

**P10:** The suburbs are doing better but the cities - Scranton, Wilkes-Barre - are struggling.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most?

**P1:** Economy. Jobs. Real jobs.

**P3:** Cost of living. Everything is expensive.

**P5:** Fuel prices hit truckers hard.

**P6:** Healthcare access and costs.

**P4:** Education funding.

### Angela Russo: Does She Know Us? (18:00 - 38:00)

**MODERATOR:** Angela Russo is the Democratic candidate. What do you think?

**P4:** She's from Pittsburgh. Does she know Scranton?

**P7:** Italian-American, that helps. We have a lot of Italians here.

**P1:** She's a Democrat who's fought for workers. That's the tradition I believe in.

**P8:** Her consumer protection work is good. Seniors getting scammed - she went after those people.

**P6:** Healthcare fraud prosecution matters. Helps patients.

**P10:** She seems competent. More substance than flash.

**P3:** She's a Democrat though. Democrats have forgotten places like this.

**P5:** What's she going to do about gas prices? That's what I need to know.

**P2:** She talks about working families. We'll see if she means it.

**P9:** I don't know much about her. Just that she's the Democrat.

**MODERATOR:** The Pittsburgh vs. NEPA thing - is it a problem?

**P4:** A little. We're used to being ignored by the rest of the state.

**P7:** Pittsburgh is more connected to us than Philly. Similar values, similar communities.

**P1:** She's got the Italian thing, the working-class thing. That transfers.

### Jeff Hartley: Rich Guy from Philly (38:00 - 55:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jeff Hartley?

**P3:** He's Republican. Republicans talk about things I care about - economy, border.

**P5:** Never heard of him. But he's not a Democrat, so...

**P1:** Pharma executive? No thanks. Those are the people charging $500 for insulin.

**P7:** Another rich guy from the suburbs. What does he know about pizza shops?

**P8:** His industry has hurt a lot of people. Drug prices are killing retirees.

**P6:** Healthcare workers hate pharma executives. They make our jobs harder.

**P2:** He seems okay but the pharma thing is bad.

**P4:** He's moderate at least. Not a crazy MAGA type.

**P10:** His education policy is vouchers. That's bad for public schools.

**P9:** I don't trust rich people who suddenly want to help regular folks.

**MODERATOR:** P3 and P5, you seem more open. What appeals?

**P3:** Republicans talk about the border, about inflation. Democrats don't.

**P5:** I'm open to whoever makes my life easier. Party doesn't matter much anymore.

**P1:** That's how they get you. They talk about border but vote against worker rights.

### The Swing Voter Reality (55:00 - 72:00)

**MODERATOR:** This region used to be solidly Democratic. What's changed?

**P1:** Democrats stopped talking about jobs. Started talking about other stuff.

**P3:** They call us racist, deplorable. Why would I vote for people who hate me?

**P8:** The party left us. We didn't leave it.

**P4:** That's too simple. Both parties have failed NEPA.

**P5:** Whoever wins, nothing changes here. Scranton is still Scranton.

**P7:** Politicians come for photo ops, then forget us.

**P10:** The education on this is hard. Democrats have done more but don't get credit.

**P6:** Healthcare investments from Democrats are real. ACA saved lives here.

**P9:** I'm young. I don't have the loyalty older folks have. I vote on what works.

**MODERATOR:** Can Russo win back this region?

**P4:** She can. She's the right profile - Italian, working-class, tough.

**P1:** If anyone can, she can. But it's a hard sell.

**P3:** She needs to talk about the border. About crime. Real concerns.

**P5:** Come here. A lot. Don't just run ads.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**P2:** Probably Russo. Healthcare matters.

**P3:** Undecided. Maybe Hartley.

**P4:** Russo. For education and unions.

**P5:** Undecided. Leaning Russo actually. Hartley is too rich.

**P6:** Russo. Healthcare worker solidarity.

**P7:** Russo. The pharma thing kills Hartley for me.

**P8:** Russo. Union loyalty.

**P9:** Probably Russo. At least she's not a pharma executive.

**P10:** Russo. Best for public schools.

## Moderator Notes

### Key Themes

1. **NEPA feels forgotten** - "Politicians come for photo ops, then forget us."

2. **Economic anxiety is deep** - Coal gone, factories gone, warehouses aren't the same.

3. **Hartley's pharma background helps Russo** - "Charging $500 for insulin" is the frame.

4. **Some voters are genuinely swing** - P3 and P5 are persuadable. Economic message matters.

5. **Low enthusiasm is problem** - 5.7 average is concerning for turnout.

6. **Italian-American connection transfers** - Russo's background resonates even from Pittsburgh.

### Vote Intent

- **Russo:** 7
- **Undecided lean Russo:** 2
- **Undecided lean Hartley:** 1

Good but not locked down.

### Swing Profiles

- **P3 (35, warehouse worker, Trump 2020):** "Democrats call us racist. Why would I vote for them?"
- **P5 (44, trucker, Teamsters):** "Whoever makes my life easier."

### Turnout Concern

Average enthusiasm 5.7 means GOTV is critical. Low-enthusiasm voters may stay home.

### Recommendations

1. **Physical presence** - "Come here. A lot."
2. **Economic specifics** - Not just rhetoric
3. **Address cultural alienation** - P3's "deplorable" comment shows lasting damage
4. **Italian-American messaging** - Helps bridge regional gap
