## Discussion

### Opening: Pittsburgh in 2024 (0:00 - 15:00)

**MODERATOR:** Thank you for being here. What's Pittsburgh like right now?

**P1:** Pittsburgh reinvented itself. Healthcare and tech replaced steel. But not everyone made the transition.

**P9:** My grandfather worked at USS Edgar Thomson. That world is gone. Now I drive Uber.

**P2:** The union jobs that remain are good. But there are fewer of them. Every contract fight is existential.

**P3:** I moved from Brooklyn for the tech scene and affordability. Pittsburgh is having a moment.

**P5:** Construction is strong. Building hospitals, universities, tech offices. Good union work.

**P6:** The environmental challenges are real - abandoned industrial sites, air quality. But we're improving.

**P7:** Downtown is struggling since COVID. Office workers aren't coming back.

**P8:** UPMC is the 800-pound gorilla. Biggest employer. Everyone here has a UPMC story.

**P4:** Mt. Lebanon is thriving. Good schools, nice neighborhoods. But drive 10 minutes and it's different.

**P10:** Being a grad student here is cheaper than other cities. But I see the inequality.

**MODERATOR:** What issues matter most?

**P2:** Union rights. Good jobs with benefits.

**P6:** Climate and environment. Just transition for workers.

**P9:** Cost of living. Making ends meet.

**P8:** Healthcare costs and access.

**P7:** Economy. Let small business survive.

### Angela Russo: Hometown Candidate (15:00 - 35:00)

**MODERATOR:** Angela Russo is from Pittsburgh. What do you think?

**P1:** She's one of us. Italian-American, working-class roots, made it through hard work.

**P2:** USW endorsed her. That's the seal of approval in this region.

**P5:** Building trades are with her. She's pro-worker.

**P4:** I've watched her as AG. She's competent, serious. Not a showboat.

**P8:** Her healthcare work has been good. Going after fraudulent practices.

**P3:** She's progressive on the issues I care about. Climate, housing.

**P6:** Environmental positions are solid. Supports clean energy transition.

**P10:** She seems authentic. Not a typical politician vibe.

**P9:** [Thoughtfully] She's saying the right things. But will anything change for people like me?

**P7:** She's not anti-business but she's not exactly pro-business either.

**MODERATOR:** The Pittsburgh connection - does it matter?

**P1:** Absolutely. She knows this region. She IS this region.

**P2:** Pittsburgh Democrats stick together. She's in the network.

**P9:** It matters that she didn't forget where she came from.

### Jeff Hartley: East vs. West (35:00 - 52:00)

**MODERATOR:** What about Jeff Hartley?

**P1:** He's a Philly guy. Main Line. What does he know about Pittsburgh?

**P2:** Pharma executive. We've seen what pharma does to healthcare costs.

**P5:** Never heard of him before this race. That's not a good sign.

**P9:** Another rich guy trying to buy a Senate seat.

**P7:** His business experience could be useful. But pharma is a tough industry to defend.

**P4:** He seems moderate. I appreciate that he's not extreme.

**P8:** As a nurse, I can't support a pharma executive. The industry is part of the problem.

**P3:** He's positioning as reasonable but his actual policies are standard Republican.

**P6:** No environmental vision. Probably pro-drilling.

**P10:** He's not speaking to young people at all.

**MODERATOR:** The East-West dynamic - does regional identity matter?

**P1:** Philadelphia and Pittsburgh are different states. He's their guy, not ours.

**P2:** Western PA looks for western PA candidates. He's an outsider here.

**P9:** We don't trust the Main Line types. They look down on us.

---

### Union and Working-Class Dynamics (52:00 - 68:00)

**MODERATOR:** Let's talk about workers and unions.

**P2:** The Steelworkers are 100% behind Russo. She's been with us on every fight.

**P5:** Building trades too. She supports prevailing wage, project labor agreements.

**P9:** I'm not union - gig economy doesn't have unions. But I know union jobs are better.

**P7:** As a business owner, I have mixed feelings about unions. But I respect them.

**P4:** My husband was union teacher. The protection mattered.

**P6:** Just transition for energy workers - Russo talks about it. Hartley doesn't.

**MODERATOR:** What about the fracking issue?

**P5:** It's complicated. Jobs in drilling are good union jobs. But environmental concerns are real.

**P6:** We need a transition, not an overnight shutdown. Russo understands that.

**P2:** USW has members in energy. We need a candidate who balances jobs and environment.

**P9:** I know people who work in fracking. They need to know their jobs won't just disappear.

**P4:** Hartley would probably be all-in on drilling. That's too extreme too.

### Closing: Vote Intent (78:00 - 90:00)

**MODERATOR:** How are you voting?

**P1:** Russo. She's our senator for Pittsburgh.

**P2:** Russo. Union all the way.

**P3:** Russo. Progressive choice.

**P4:** Probably Russo. Moderate and competent.

**P5:** Russo. Building trades.

**P6:** Russo. Environment and just transition.

**P7:** Leaning Russo. Better for this region than Hartley.

**P8:** Russo. Healthcare.

**P9:** Russo. She at least talks about people like me.

**P10:** Russo. First vote in PA will be for her.

**P2:** 10.

**P3:** 7.
