# Post-Race Strategy Memo

**Race:** Pennsylvania Senate 2024
**Candidate:** Angela Russo (D)
**Opponent:** Jeff Hartley (R)
**Outcome:** Win (+3.1%)
**Date:** December 2024
**Prepared by:** Campaign Strategy Team

## Executive Summary

Angela Russo won the Pennsylvania Senate race by 3.1 points, holding an open seat in a presidential year. The win was built on three pillars: (1) Hartley's pharmaceutical executive background proved toxic on healthcare costs, (2) suburban Philadelphia delivered decisive margins, and (3) Pittsburgh's union base turned out enthusiastically. NEPA remained soft but came home, as Russo's Italian-American working-class identity bridged regional gaps.

## What Worked

### 1. Pharmaceutical Executive Attack

Hartley's pharma background was devastating across all three focus groups:

**Philly suburbs (P10):** "Pharma executive? After what they've done to drug prices? Absolutely not."

**Pittsburgh (P8):** "As a nurse, I can't support a pharma executive. The industry is part of the problem."

**NEPA (P1):** "Those are the people charging $500 for insulin."

Even P2 (Philly suburbs), who works in pharma, voted Russo. The "made millions while drug prices soared" frame was unanswerable.

### 2. Pittsburgh Regional Identity

Russo's Pittsburgh roots generated unanimous support:

- 10-0 in Pittsburgh focus group
- Average enthusiasm 7.4
- "She's one of us" - P1

The Italian-American working-class identity translated well to NEPA (also heavily Italian-American), providing some regional bridge.

### 3. Philadelphia Suburbs Delivered

Strong performance in collar counties:

- 7-2 Russo in focus group with 1 lean
- Healthcare messaging resonated with professional women
- Abortion remained motivating issue
- P6 (Republican lean) came to Russo on pharma issue

### 4. Consumer Protection Frame

Russo's AG record provided credibility:

**Philly P3:** "Prosecuted consumer fraud cases. That's credibility."

The "prosecutor fighting for consumers vs. executive profiting from consumers" frame was coherent and compelling.

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. NEPA Enthusiasm Gap

Average enthusiasm in NEPA was only 5.7/10:

**P5 (Scranton):** "Whoever wins, nothing changes here."

The region feels forgotten and cynical. Votes came but not with energy.

### 2. Cultural Alienation Persists

NEPA focus group revealed lasting damage:

**P3:** "They call us racist, deplorable. Why would I vote for people who hate me?"

**P8:** "The party left us. We didn't leave it."

Russo won these voters but the relationship is fragile.

### 3. Economic Specificity Wanted

Across focus groups, voters wanted more concrete economic plans:

**Scranton P5:** "What's she going to do about gas prices? That's what I need to know."

Generic "fighting for working families" language is wearing thin.

## Key Learnings for Future Races

### 1. Opponent Background Can Be Determinative

Hartley's pharma executive background provided a perfect contrast. In healthcare-cost-focused races, industry executives are at massive disadvantage.

### 2. Regional Identity Matters in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is three states: Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and rural/NEPA. Candidates must bridge at least two. Russo's Pittsburgh roots + Italian-American identity provided credibility in NEPA.

### 3. Suburban Philadelphia Is Decisive

The collar counties delivered the margin. Any Democratic statewide path runs through Chester, Montgomery, Delaware, and Bucks.

### 4. NEPA Requires Maintenance

The region is persuadable but feels abandoned. Physical presence, economic specificity, and cultural respect are required.

### 5. Healthcare Costs Unite

Across regions and demographics, healthcare costs were top concern. This is a winning Democratic frame when opponent can be tied to industry.

## Voter Segment Analysis

| Segment | Vote | Enthusiasm | Key Drivers |
|---------|------|------------|-------------|
| Philly suburbs | 7-2 Russo | 7.0 | Healthcare, pharma attack |

## Geographic Performance

**Philadelphia Suburbs (Chester, Montgomery, Delaware, Bucks):**
- Delivered decisive margin
- Healthcare professionals motivated
- Abortion continued to matter
- Hartley's "moderate" positioning couldn't overcome pharma baggage

**Pittsburgh/Allegheny County:**
- Base turnout strong
- Union endorsements delivered
- "One of us" regional identity powerful
- 10-0 in focus group reflects actual performance

**NEPA (Lackawanna, Luzerne, surrounding):**
- Came home but without enthusiasm
- Cultural alienation persists
- Pharma attack provided permission structure
- Requires long-term investment

---

## The Pharma Frame

This race demonstrated how opponent biography can define a contest.

**What worked:**
- "Made millions while drug prices soared"
- "Her industry is why patients can't afford insulin"
- "Consumer protection prosecutor vs. industry executive"

**What Hartley couldn't escape:**
- Personal wealth from pharma
- Industry association with price gouging
- No convincing counter-narrative

## Recommendations for Pennsylvania Democrats

1. **Healthcare costs messaging** - Continue to lead with it. It's unifying.

2. **Opponent research on industry ties** - Pharma, insurance, any industry with cost problems is vulnerable.

3. **Physical presence in NEPA** - "Come here. A lot." is the advice from voters.

4. **Italian-American outreach** - Pittsburgh and NEPA share this heritage. It's a bridge.

5. **Economic specificity** - Move from "fighting for you" to "here's what I'll do: [specific policy]"

6. **Acknowledge cultural alienation** - Don't ignore the "deplorable" damage. Address it directly.

7. **Union coordination** - USW, building trades, Teamsters deliver in Pennsylvania.

## Margin Analysis

**Final margin: +3.1% (approximately 210,000 votes)**

**Where it came from:**
- Philadelphia suburbs: +150,000
- Pittsburgh/Allegheny: +80,000
- NEPA: +10,000 (underperformed)
- Rural PA: -30,000 net loss

**Coalition was regionally uneven but sufficient.**
