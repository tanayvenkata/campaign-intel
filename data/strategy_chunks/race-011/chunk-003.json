  "content": "The revelation of Chambers' offensive online comments - about women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people - was the race-ending moment. Every focus group reacted with revulsion:\n\n**Charlotte P8 (lifelong Republican):** \"I've voted Republican my whole life. I can't vote for him. Period.\"\n\n**Rural P7 (military conservative):** \"I can't look my granddaughters in the eye if I vote for someone who says those things.\"\n\n**Triangle P5 (LGBTQ+):** \"He's called people like me 'filth.'
