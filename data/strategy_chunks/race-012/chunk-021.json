  "content": "1. **Recruit candidates with working-class backgrounds** - Biography matters. Authenticity can't be manufactured.\n\n2. **Healthcare costs is the economic message** - More specific than \"fighting for workers.\"\n\n3. **Invest in Fox Valley** - This region is persuadable with local candidates and specific messages.\n\n4. **Maintain 2011 infrastructure** - Union networks, Capitol protest alumni - this is a unique Wisconsin asset.\n\n5. **Don't cede WOW counties** - Healthcare and abortion create openings even in traditionally Republican suburbs.\n\n6. **Resist \"Madison liberal\" framing** - Candidates from outside Madison have natural advantage.\n\n---",
