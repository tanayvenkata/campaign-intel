  "content": "Reproductive rights was our highest-testing message:\n- WOW Counties: 3.4/5\n- Madison: 4.1/5\n- Fox Valley: mobilizing for P6, P2\n\nBut abortion alone couldn't overcome economic headwinds. Key quotes:\n\n- WOW Counties P9: \"My grocery bill is up $200 a month. That's every month. That's $2,400 a year.\"\n- Fox Valley P1: \"I'm pro-choice personally but the economy is my bigger concern.\"\n- WOW Counties P3: \"Abortion is a side issue for me. The economy is what affects my daily life.\"\n\n**Lesson:** Abortion could galvanize turnout but couldn't persuade swing voters away from their economic concerns. We needed both issues, not just one.",
