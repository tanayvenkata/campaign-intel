  "content": "Our core economic message - \"fight for working families by taking on corporate greed and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share\" - was roundly rejected across all voter segments.\n\n**Focus group evidence:**\n\n| Group | Message Score | Representative Quote |\n|-------|---------------|---------------------|\n| WOW Counties | 1.5/5 | \"Corporate greed. Really? That's simplistic nonsense.\" |\n| Madison | 2.3/5 | \"This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now.\" |\n| Fox Valley | 2.1/5 | \"This sounds like every Democrat ever. Things don't change.\" |\n\n**Why it failed:**\n\n1. **Not addressing the moment:** Voters were experiencing real inflation pain. \"Corporate greed\" felt like deflection, not solution.\n\n2. **Lack of specificity:** \"Fight for working families\" is meaningless without policy detail. Voters demanded numbers.\n\n3. **Stale language:** This messaging has been Democratic boilerplate for 30 years. Voters are immune to it.\n\n4. **No acknowledgment of inflation:** By blaming \"greed\" rather than acknowledging government policy role in inflation, we seemed out of touch.\n\n**Contrast with winning campaigns:** Michigan and Pennsylvania Democrats who won in 2022 moved to SPECIFIC policy messaging - \"$35 insulin cap,\" \"cut the gas tax,\" \"save $800/year.\" We never made that pivot.",
