Our focus groups identified these problems in September, but the campaign did not adapt in time. This memo is a candid assessment of what went wrong, what warning signs we missed, and what future campaigns must learn from this defeat.\n\n**Bottom line:** We lost on the economy. Generic populist messaging failed to address voter concerns about inflation. Our opponent's business background gave him credibility we never matched. Abortion was a strong issue but insufficient to overcome economic headwinds.\n\n---",

Things don't change.\" |\n\n**Why it failed:**\n\n1. **Not addressing the moment:** Voters were experiencing real inflation pain. \"Corporate greed\" felt like deflection, not solution.\n\n2. **Lack of specificity:** \"Fight for working families\" is meaningless without policy detail. Voters demanded numbers.\n\n3. **Stale language:** This messaging has been Democratic boilerplate for 30 years. Voters are immune to it.\n\n4. **No acknowledgment of inflation:** By blaming \"greed\" rather than acknowledging government policy role in inflation, we seemed out of touch.\n\n**Contrast with winning campaigns:** Michigan and Pennsylvania Democrats who won in 2022 moved to SPECIFIC policy messaging - \"$35 insulin cap,\" \"cut the gas tax,\" \"save $800/year.\" We never made that pivot.",

A candidate who \"made a payroll\" has instant credibility.\n\n2. **\"Career politician\" attack landed:** Kowalski's trajectory (teacher \u2192 state senator) became a liability when paired with Lindquist's private-sector experience.\n\n3. **No business validators:** We had union endorsements but lacked business community voices who could vouch for Kowalski's economic seriousness.",
