  "content": "Our Madison focus group in September revealed alarming enthusiasm gaps in our base territory:\n\n- Average enthusiasm for Kowalski: 5.6/10 (should be 8+ in Dane County)\n- P8: \"I might not vote. Honestly.\"\n- P4: \"Generic Democrat. Doesn't speak to what I care about.\"\n- P9: \"This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now.\"\n\n**Why the base was soft:**\n\n1. **No inspiring vision:** Kowalski was seen as competent but uninspiring. \"Fine but not exciting.\"\n\n2. **Issue gaps:** Climate voters (P5) felt ignored. Criminal justice reformers (P10) saw nothing in the agenda.\n\n3. **Burnout from continuous fighting:** Since 2011 (Act 10), Wisconsin progressives have been in constant battle mode. Exhaustion is real.\n\n4. **Biden drag:** The campaign never created distance from unpopular national Democratic brand on inflation.",
