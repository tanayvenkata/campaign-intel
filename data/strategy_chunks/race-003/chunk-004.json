  "content": "Steve Lindquist ran a manufacturing company before entering politics. This gave him economic credibility we could not match with a teacher-turned-politician biography.\n\n**Focus group evidence:**\n\n- Fox Valley: \"He created jobs, right? That's more than most politicians have done.\"\n- WOW Counties: \"Jobs creator versus career politician\" - his message scored 3.7/5 vs. our 2.1/5\n- Fox Valley: Union member said \"My union won't like it but that's my lean\" toward Lindquist\n\n**Why this hurt us:**\n\n1. **Manufacturing context:** Wisconsin's Fox Valley is manufacturing-heavy. A candidate who \"made a payroll\" has instant credibility.\n\n2. **\"Career politician\" attack landed:** Kowalski's trajectory (teacher \u2192 state senator) became a liability when paired with Lindquist's private-sector experience.\n\n3. **No business validators:** We had union endorsements but lacked business community voices who could vouch for Kowalski's economic seriousness.",
