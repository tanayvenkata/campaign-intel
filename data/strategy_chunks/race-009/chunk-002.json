  "content": "Lisa Kowalski won the open Michigan Senate seat by 4.2 points, outperforming expectations in a presidential year. Three factors delivered victory: (1) working-class auto industry credibility that resonated across the state, (2) abortion as a persistent mobilizing issue in suburban areas, and (3) DeGroot's CEO background becoming a liability rather than asset. Focus groups showed the race turning on authenticity and economic identity - Kowalski's \"autoworker's daughter\" narrative beat DeGroot's \"job creator\" frame.\n\n---",
