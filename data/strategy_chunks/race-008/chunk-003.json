  "content": "The Lewistown focus group was devastating. Among ranchers who knew Sullivan personally, some for decades, the vote was 5-2 for Hansen.\n\n**P1 (knew Sullivan 30 years, Sullivan helped him personally):** \"Jack is a good man. But his party isn't.\"\n\n**P4 (voted Sullivan three times before):** \"It breaks my heart... for the first time ever, straight Republican.\"\n\n**The mechanism:** Party brand became more important than personal relationship. Rural Montanans weren't voting FOR Hansen; they were voting AGAINST Democrats.",
