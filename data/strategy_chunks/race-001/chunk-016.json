  "content": "**Oakland County:** Our strongest suburban performance. Abortion + candidate quality + suburban fatigue with GOP extremism.\n\n**Grand Rapids/Kent County:** Closer than expected. Economic anxiety high, abortion cross-pressured. Business community reachable with right message.\n\n**Flint/Genesee County:** AG record was gold. \"Never another Flint\" infrastructure message landed hard.\n\n**Traverse City/Northern Michigan:** Tourism economy concerns, housing affordability. Reachable on economics if we invest earlier.\n\n**Rural Michigan:** Underperformed. Need rural-specific strategy for future races.\n\n---",
