  "content": "**Strengths:**\n- Exceptional communicator (TV training)\n- Connected to MAGA base energy\n- Simple, memorable messaging\n- Charismatic in person and on camera\n\n**Fatal Weaknesses:**\n- Election denial alienated swing voters\n- Lacked policy depth\n- \"Invasion\" rhetoric offensive to Latino voters\n- Couldn't pivot to general election tone\n\n**Lesson:** Strong primary candidates can be weak general election candidates. Extremism that wins primaries can lose generals - if properly messaged against.\n\n---",
