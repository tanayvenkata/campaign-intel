  "content": "1. **Maintain McCain Republican outreach** - This coalition is fragile but real. Don't abandon it.\n\n2. **Develop substantive border position** - Cannot cede this issue. Practical reform messaging needed.\n\n3. **Invest in water policy** - First candidate with serious water plan has significant advantage.\n\n4. **Year-round Latino engagement** - Not just turnout but authentic community presence.\n\n5. **Positive vision needed** - Anti-extremism is motivating but not sufficient. What is Arizona becoming?\n\n6. **Suburban women remain key** - Abortion + democracy combination is powerful in educated suburbs.\n\n---",
