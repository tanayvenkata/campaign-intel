  "content": "The central message - \"She defended your vote\" - was devastatingly effective. Focus groups showed:\n\n**Maricopa suburbs:**\n- McCain Republicans (P1, P4, P6) explicitly cited election denial as disqualifying\n- \"If she won't accept results, she can't be governor\" - P6\n- Message testing showed \"defender\" frame scored highest (8-10 range)\n\n**Latino Phoenix:**\n- Naturalized citizens felt their votes were personally attacked\n- \"She'd throw out my vote because she didn't like the result? No.\" - P8\n\n**Key execution:**\n- Emphasized Reyes' courage under death threats\n- Stark contrast: \"She certified. Mitchell says she wouldn't have.\"\n- Connected to broader democracy concerns",
