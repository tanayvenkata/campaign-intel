  "content": "Latino focus group (P4, P2) revealed frustration:\n\n> \"Democrats don't always take [the border] seriously enough.\"\n\n> \"Neither party actually fixes it.\"\n\n**Problem:** Mitchell attacked on border constantly. Our response was defensive, not substantive. Persuadable Latino voters (small business owners, border community ties) wanted practical solutions, not just rejecting \"invasion\" rhetoric.\n\n**Learning:** You can't cede border entirely to Republicans when running in a border state. Need substantive position that doesn't alienate progressives but shows seriousness.",
