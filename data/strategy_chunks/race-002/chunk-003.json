  "content": "The race was won on candidate quality more than policy differentiation. Marchetti's biography vs. Thornton's biography told the entire story:\n\n| Factor | Marchetti | Thornton |\n|--------|-----------|----------|\n| Background | Steelworker's son, Scranton | Hedge fund billionaire, Wall Street |\n| Residency | Lifelong Pennsylvanian | Moved to PA 10 years ago |\n| Experience | Mayor, Lt. Governor | No political experience |\n| Authenticity | \"One of us\" | \"Carpet-bagger,\" \"trying to buy seat\" |\n\n**Key message that tested highest:** \"Tony Marchetti grew up in Scranton, son of a steelworker. He paid his way through college, served his community as mayor, and fights for working families every day. David Thornton made billions on Wall Street, moved to Pennsylvania ten years ago, and now wants to buy a Senate seat.\"\n\n**Evidence from focus groups:**\n- Philadelphia suburbs: \"It's like two different worlds. One grew up working class. The other was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.\" - P1\n- Pittsburgh: \"One guy's family built things. The other guy's family profited from tearing things down.\" - P7\n- Scranton: \"Tony IS one of us. Thornton is not.\" - P5\n\n**Lesson:** When you have a clear candidate quality advantage, make it central. Don't bury it beneath policy wonkery.",
