  "content": "**Philadelphia Suburbs (Collar Counties):** Strongest performance. Abortion + candidate quality + Trump exhaustion combined for decisive wins. Montgomery, Chester, Bucks all shifted significantly Democratic.\n\n**Pittsburgh/Allegheny County:** Margin met targets. Union voters came home strongly. Marchetti's working-class credentials passed the authenticity test.\n\n**Scranton/Lackawanna County:** Overperformance. Hometown advantage was real and large. This should be model for candidate recruitment.\n\n**Erie County:** Closer than expected. Working-class economic messaging resonated. Future investment opportunity.\n\n**Rural Pennsylvania:** Underperformed. Needs dedicated strategy if we want to cut margins.\n\n---",
