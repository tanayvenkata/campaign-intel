  "content": "1. **Candidate recruitment priority:** Seek candidates with authentic working-class roots and demonstrated community connection. Carpetbagger risk is real.\n\n2. **Develop NEPA as regional identity base:** Scranton/Wilkes-Barre corridor is distinct. Build permanent organization treating it as separate from Philadelphia.\n\n3. **Social Security/Medicare permanent messaging:** Every Democratic candidate should be defined as the defender of these programs. Force Republicans to either commit or evade.\n\n4. **Maintain abortion centrality:** This issue isn't going away in Pennsylvania. Build it into every campaign infrastructure.\n\n5. **Test rural outreach:** We wrote off rural PA too quickly. With right candidate and right message, margins could be cut.\n\n6. **Prepare \"buy the election\" attacks:** When facing wealthy self-funders, have this frame ready from day one.\n\n---",
