  "content": "Marchetti's Scranton roots provided an unbeatable advantage in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Every Scranton-specific detail resonated:\n\n- Scranton Prep (local private school)\n- University of Scranton (local college)\n- Chamberlain Steel (where his father worked)\n- St. Peter's Cathedral (family's church)\n- \"I could run into him at Coopers\" (local bar)\n\nThis hometown credibility translated to trust. Voters believed he would fight for them because he couldn't escape them - he's literally their neighbor.\n\n**Evidence from Scranton focus group:**\n- All 10 participants leaning or committed to Marchetti\n- \"Having one of our own in the Senate would be huge.\" - P5\n- \"He can't forget where he came from when he literally still lives here.\" - P1\n\n**Lesson:** Authentic local connection creates accountability trust that money can't buy.",
