  "content": "Counter to the assumption that self-funding provides advantage, Thornton's wealth became his biggest liability:\n\n- \"Hedge fund\" triggered negative associations (betting against America, extraction, not building)\n- \"Billionaire\" signaled out-of-touch rather than success\n- \"Buy a Senate seat\" framing stuck because it felt true\n\n**Evidence from focus groups:**\n- Pittsburgh: \"Hedge funds are parasites. They don't build anything. They just extract value.\" - P3\n- Philadelphia suburbs: \"You can tell he's never shopped at Target.\" - P8\n- Scranton: \"I don't trust anyone that wealthy. They don't know what it's like to decide between groceries and medicine.\" - P9\n\n**Lesson:** Self-funding can backfire if the candidate can be framed as trying to \"buy\" office. Wealth needs a positive story attached; without one, it's a vulnerability.",
