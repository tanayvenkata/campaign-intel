  "content": "1. **Maintain Culinary Union relationship** - This is the single most important asset. Protect it.\n\n2. **Year-round Northern Nevada presence** - Cannot only show up for elections. Ongoing visibility needed.\n\n3. **Develop economic counter-narrative** - Need response to \"inflation = Democrats\" that's more compelling than \"it's global.\"\n\n4. **Segment Latino outreach** - Different approaches for progressive community members vs. conservative/business-oriented.\n\n5. **Specific over general** - Name policies, show concrete benefits. \"Capped insulin at $35\" beats \"fighting for you.\"\n\n6. **Housing policy priority** - This is becoming a cross-partisan concern. Lead on it.\n\n7. **Water messaging for future** - Lake Mead crisis is coming. Get ahead of it.\n\n---",
