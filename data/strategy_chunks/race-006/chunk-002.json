  "content": "Maria Sandoval won re-election by 0.8 points - roughly 7,500 votes - in the closest Senate race in the country. Victory came from three sources: Culinary Union turnout operation, Latino community mobilization, and Northern Nevada persuadables who rejected Prescott's extremism when pressed. The enthusiasm gap was real and concerning - average enthusiasm across all three focus groups was only 7.1/10. This was a race won by organization and opponent weakness, not inspiration.\n\n---",
