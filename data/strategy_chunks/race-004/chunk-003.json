  "content": "The race was won on character. Every focus group showed Harrison's scandals as disqualifying:\n\n**Key dynamics:**\n- Pro-life candidate who allegedly paid for multiple abortions = \"hypocrisy at highest level\"\n- Personal scandals made \"family values\" argument hollow\n- Even Republican participants (Cobb P4, Albany P3) refused to vote for him\n\n**Evidence from focus groups:**\n- Atlanta suburbs: \"He's running on pro-life and he allegedly paid for abortions?\" - P7\n- Black Atlanta: \"It's actually offensive. Like they think we'll vote for any Black face.\" - P10\n- Rural: \"As a Republican saying that, Harrison is just... no.\" - P3",
