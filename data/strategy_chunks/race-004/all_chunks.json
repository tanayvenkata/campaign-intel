Harrison's personal scandals (abortion hypocrisy, abuse allegations) combined with his lack of policy knowledge made him unacceptable even to Republican-leaning voters. Williams' pastoral credibility provided moral authority that resonated across demographics - from suburban professionals to rural church communities.\n\n---",
