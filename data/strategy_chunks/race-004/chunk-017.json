  "content": "1. **Character screening in recruitment** - Harrison's vulnerabilities were known. Don't let flawed candidates through.\n\n2. **Invest in rural Georgia** - The \"Dollar General economy\" is real. Show up, listen, deliver.\n\n3. **Medicaid expansion as flagship** - In rural areas, this is the tangible policy that would transform lives.\n\n4. **Church partnership as infrastructure** - Not just during elections but year-round presence.\n\n5. **Combat voter suppression directly** - The new laws are suppressive. Challenge them legally and work around them organizationally.\n\n6. **Maintain Stacey Abrams infrastructure** - The organizing built 2018-2022 is an asset. Don't let it atrophy.\n\n---\n\n*This memo reflects analysis of three focus groups (Atlanta suburbs, Atlanta Black voters, Rural Southwest Georgia) conducted September 2022, post-election research, and campaign performance data.*",
