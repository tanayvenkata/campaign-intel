  "content": "The Youngstown focus group was prophetic. P5 (construction, union, voted Brennan twice before) said it clearly:\n\n> \"The Democrats had decades to help us. They didn't. They focused on the cities, on minorities, on college kids. We got nothing.\"\n\n**Final result in Mahoning County:** Brennan -8 vs. his 2018 performance. The union base crumbled.\n\n**Key defector profile:**\n- Union members who voted Obama twice, Trump twice, and Brennan for Senate\n- When party frustration exceeded personal loyalty to Brennan, they left\n- \"Democrats assume we'll vote for them\" - this resentment was fatal",
