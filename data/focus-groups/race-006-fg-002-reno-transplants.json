    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Transplant dynamic is complex** - New arrivals brought money, drove up costs, changed culture. Both appreciated and resented.\n\n2. **Prescott's moderate image is thin** - When pressed, participants discovered MAGA connections. The \"reasonable businessman\" frame collapsed.\n\n3. **Northern Nevada resentment** - \"Vegas decides everything.\" Sandoval seen as Vegas candidate.\n\n4. **Enthusiasm gap is real** - 6.1 average is very low. Many voting against Prescott rather than for Sandoval.\n\n5. **Abortion mattered for younger women** - P6 explicitly cited it as decisive.\n\n6. **Climate and environment** - Smoke season, Lake Tahoe, drought - outdoor enthusiasts care about climate.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sandoval:** 9\n- **Leaning Sandoval:** 1\n- **Enthusiasm range:** 4-8 (average 6.1)\n\n### Persuadable Voters\n\n- **P5** (retired teacher, moderate Republican): Leaning Sandoval but at 4 enthusiasm. Could stay home.\n- **P2** and **P9** (longtime residents): Low enthusiasm, resentment of Vegas dominance. Need Reno-specific outreach.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Reno visibility needed** - Senator needs more Northern Nevada presence.\n2. **Expose Prescott's extremism** - Moderate image is fragile.\n3. **Economic specifics** - Generic messaging isn't enough for this audience.\n4. **Housing policy** - Cross-cutting issue for transplants and natives alike.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I sold my Mountain View house for $2 million, bought here for $600K. I get why locals resent us.\" - P1\n\n> \"The moderate image is fake.\" - P1 (on Prescott)\n\n> \"If he was actually moderate, maybe. But he's playing a character.\" - P9\n\n> \"Convince me Sandoval will be independent from the national party.\" - P5\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Silver State Research*\n*September 25, 2022*\n"
