    "full_text": "\n### CRITICAL WARNING: ECONOMIC MESSAGE FAILURE\n\n**This focus group reveals a serious messaging problem.**\n\n1. **Generic populism is being rejected** - \"Fight for working families\" and \"corporate greed\" scored 1.5/5. These voters see through it.\n\n2. **The inflation attack is landing hard** - Lindquist's \"Madison liberal/Biden agenda/inflation\" message scored 3.9/5. This is devastating.\n\n3. **Biography without policy isn't working** - \"Union household\" story scored 2.3/5. \"What's the plan NOW?\" was repeated reaction.\n\n4. **Specificity is demanded but not provided** - Multiple participants asked for concrete numbers, concrete policies. They're not getting them.\n\n5. **Abortion alone isn't enough** - Even conflicted voters (P3, P5) are prioritizing economy. The freedom message (3.4/5) beats economic messages but not decisive.\n\n### Vote Intent Analysis\n\n- **Firm Lindquist:** P1, P4, P9, P10 (4)\n- **Leaning Lindquist:** P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P8 (6)\n- **Leaning/Undecided Kowalski:** (0)\n\n**This is a 10-0 room leaning Republican.** In a swing state, that's a disaster.\n\n### Key Quotes Showing Failure\n\n> \"Corporate greed. Really? That's the explanation for inflation? That's simplistic nonsense.\" - P1\n\n> \"Biography doesn't equal policy. I don't care where she grew up.\" - P5\n\n> \"My grocery bill is up $200 a month. That's every month. That's $2,400 a year.\" - P9\n\n> \"Even if true, how does attacking Lindquist lower gas prices?\" - P9\n\n> \"If Kowalski had a credible economic plan, I might reconsider. She doesn't.\" - P3\n\n### Recommendations for Campaign\n\n1. **URGENT: Develop specific economic policies** - Generic populism is losing. Need tangible plans with numbers.\n\n2. **Acknowledge inflation is real** - These voters feel dismissed when told \"corporate greed\" is the problem.\n\n3. **Break from Biden explicitly** - Every voter connects Kowalski to Biden to inflation. She must create distance.\n\n4. **Lean harder into abortion** - It's the only message with positive traction. But it can't be the only message.\n\n5. **Find business validators** - \"Has she ever made a payroll?\" is asked. Need credible economic surrogates.\n\n### WOW County Warning\n\nThe WOW counties are traditionally Republican but have been trending competitive. If generic economic messaging is failing THIS badly in persuadable suburban rooms, the race may be slipping away.\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Heartland Research Group*\n*September 15, 2022*\n*STATUS: URGENT REVIEW REQUIRED*\n"
