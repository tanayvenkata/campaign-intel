    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes - TURNOUT IS THE RACE\n\n1. **Unanimous Sullivan support** - No one is voting Hansen. The question is whether they vote at all.\n\n2. **Turnout barriers are real** - Distance, ID requirements, cynicism, disengagement. P2 and P5 may not vote.\n\n3. **Sullivan relationship is strong** - 18 years of showing up, delivering, building trust. Hansen is a stranger.\n\n4. **Cynicism is deep** - \"What's in it for me?\" \"Nothing changes.\" Hard to counter.\n\n5. **Youth are the wildcard** - P9 is engaged and organizing. P5 may or may not vote for the first time.\n\n6. **Fear messaging works but is depressing** - \"Protecting what we've built\" motivates but doesn't inspire.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sullivan:** 9\n- **Hansen:** 0\n\n### Turnout Likelihood\n\n- **Definitely voting (8-10):** 6\n- **Maybe voting (5-7):** 3\n\nAverage: 8.3 - Good but not great.\n\n### Critical Mobilization Targets\n\n- **P2 (construction worker, 34):** \"If I vote, probably Sullivan.\" Likelihood 5. Needs concrete motivation.\n- **P5 (healthcare worker, 28):** First-time voter, might vote. Likelihood 6. Needs peer outreach.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Turnout operation on reservations** - Transportation, ID assistance, early voting push\n2. **Youth-to-youth organizing** - P9 type activists reaching P5 type potentials\n3. **Fear + hope combination** - What we're defending AND what we're building\n4. **Concrete wins, not just relationships** - \"IHS funding increased by X\" not just \"I listen\"\n5. **Polling location access** - Push for more locations, earlier voting hours\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I'd vote if I thought it mattered. Convince me it matters.\" - P5\n\n> \"Nothing ever changes so... why bother?\" - P2\n\n> \"He doesn't just show up for votes. He's built relationships.\" - P8\n\n> \"We're always defending, never advancing.\" - P8\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Northern Plains Research*\n*September 25, 2024*\n"
