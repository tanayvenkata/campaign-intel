    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **COVID trauma lingers** - Workers remember being abandoned. Union loyalty deepened.\n\n2. **Economic pain is real** - Inflation erased wage gains. Housing crisis acute. \"Paycheck to paycheck\" repeated.\n\n3. **Union endorsement carries weight** - But not blindly followed. Members want to understand why.\n\n4. **Sandoval seen as ally** - Her hospitality background resonates. But some want louder fighting.\n\n5. **Prescott seen as threat** - Non-union hotel owner is disqualifying for union members.\n\n6. **Enthusiasm gap is real** - 7.3 average is concerning. P2 and P6 at 5-6 are potential dropoffs.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sandoval:** 10\n- **Enthusiasm range:** 5-9 (average 7.3)\n\n### Turnout Concerns\n\n- P2 and P6 are lower enthusiasm. Economic frustration could depress turnout.\n- Union machine will need to work to maintain engagement.\n- \"Not thrilled but...\" is not inspiring.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I was out of work for 14 months. If not for the union fighting for us, I'd have lost everything.\" - P1\n\n> \"I make $25 an hour with tips. My rent is $1,800.
