    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Profound sense of abandonment** - \"We're invisible,\" \"nobody cares about us,\" \"flyover country.\" This isn't partisan - it's directed at both parties.\n\n2. **Generic Democratic messaging fails completely** - \"Corporate greed\" scored 1.75/5. They literally laughed at it. \"There's no corporations up here.\"\n\n3. **Rural-specific messaging works dramatically better** - Broadband, rural hospitals, family farms scored 3.25/5. A 1.5-point jump just from speaking to their actual concerns.\n\n4. **Flint/accountability message resonates** - Even in Trump country, holding government accountable for Flint landed (3.5/5). Proof over promises.\n\n5. **Economic anxiety is crushing but different than suburban** - It's not just \"prices going up.\" It's farm input costs, hospital closures, brain drain, dying towns. Different texture.\n\n6. **Cultural alienation is real and deep** - \"Deplorables,\" \"bitter clingers\" - they remember these insults. There's resentment from feeling looked down upon.\n\n7. **Abortion is complicated here too** - Even P4 (most conservative) acknowledged absolute bans go too far. It's not uniform opposition.\n\n### Moderator Self-Note: Managing P4\n\nP4 dominated early portions of the discussion and needed to be redirected several times. His views are important data but were crowding out other voices. I made deliberate effort to draw out quieter participants (P7, P8) after the first section.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Likely Vanderberg:** P1, P4, P6 (3)\n- **Likely Holloway:** P3 (1)\n- **Genuinely Undecided:** P2, P5, P7 (3)\n- **Would not share:** P8 (1)\n\nThis is a 3-1-3-1 room in strong Republican territory. The undecideds are notable - these could be reached with right message.\n\n### What Would Move Rural Voters\n\n1. **Physical presence** - Campaign here. Not photo ops - real town halls, real listening.\n\n2. **Rural-specific policy** - Broadband, rural healthcare, farm policy. Not \"working families\" generic.\n\n3. **Accountability proof** - Flint prosecution was credible. More concrete accomplishments, less promises.\n\n4. **Respect** - Stop treating rural voters as lost cause or cultural enemy. They know when they're being condescended to.\n\n5. **Follow-through** - Broken promises have accumulated for decades. Any new promise starts in a trust deficit.\n\n### Why Democrats Are Losing Here\n\n1. Economic messaging doesn't translate (\"corporate greed\" = laughed at)\n2. Cultural messaging feels hostile (\"they think we're stupid racists\")\n3. No visible presence or investment\n4. Generic \"working families\" ignores rural-specific issues\n5. Trust has been broken by decades of ignored promises\n\n### Verbatim Quotes for Strategy\n\n> \"Politicians come up here during hunting season, put on an orange vest for a photo, and then forget about us for four years.\" - P1\n\n> \"'Corporate greed.' Lady, there's no corporations up here. There's farmers and small businesses trying to survive.\" - P1\n\n> \"We're in 2022 and kids are driving to the McDonald's parking lot to use WiFi for homework.\" - P5\n\n> \"We're invisible. That's how it feels. Like we're invisible.\" - P7\n\n> \"Democrats write us off as lost cause Trump voters. Republicans take us for granted because where else are we gonna go?\" - P1\n\n> \"I'm pro-life but I'm not heartless. There are situations where it's not black and white.\" - P4\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Northern Michigan Research Associates*\n*September 16, 2022*\n*STATUS: DIAGNOSTIC - RURAL UNDERPERFORMANCE EXPLAINED*\n"
