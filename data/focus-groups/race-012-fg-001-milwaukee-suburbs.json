P7 (Thompson lean) says \"abortion is a problem.\"\n\n3. **Thompson's business message is generic** - \"Pro-business\" doesn't address specific concerns.\n\n4. **Not a wipeout either way** - 4-2-4 split shows competitive race.\n\n5. **\"Made millions\" attack is debatable** - Some see it as unfair, others see it as valid contrast.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Schroeder:** 4\n- **Lean Schroeder:** 2\n- **Thompson:** 2\n- **Lean Thompson:** 2\n\nCompetitive in traditionally Republican territory.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"Healthcare is personal. She's been there.\" - P1\n\n> \"Business executives don't understand healthcare from the patient side.\" - P5\n\n> \"Abortion is a problem\" - P7 (on Thompson's weakness)\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Wisconsin Research Partners*\n*September 25, 2024*\n"
