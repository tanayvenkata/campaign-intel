    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Character contrast is overwhelming** - Harrison's personal scandals vs. Williams' pastoral integrity created decisive gap. This wasn't close.\n\n2. **Republican defections are real** - P4 and P6 are voting against their party specifically because of Harrison's unfitness.\n\n3. **Abortion galvanized suburban women** - P1, P7, P8 explicitly cited it as decisive. Georgia's 6-week ban is unpopular here.\n\n4. **Cobb County transformation continues** - Diverse, educated, professional suburbs are now competitive terrain.\n\n5. **Williams' pastoral identity is asset** - Even non-religious participants (P1, P9) respected his moral authority.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Williams:** 10\n- **Harrison:** 0\n- **Undecided:** 0\n\nThis is a 10-0 room in a swing county. Remarkable unanimity.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I'm a lifelong Republican saying that. Harrison is unacceptable.\" - P4\n\n> \"They nominated him because he's famous, not because he's qualified. That's insulting.\" - P2\n\n> \"A pastor with integrity versus... whatever Harrison is.\" - P10\n\n> \"He's running on pro-life and he allegedly paid for multiple abortions?\" - P7\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Peachtree Research Group*\n*September 20, 2022*\n"
