    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Economic distress is severe** - Dollar General economy, healthcare deserts, farm struggles. This is real poverty, not just inflation concerns.\n\n2. **Williams has rural credibility** - Visits to Albany, meeting with Black farmers, church appearances. He's invested in building connection.\n\n3. **Harrison rejected even by persuadables** - P3 (Republican) and P7 (independent) voting Williams. Harrison's unfitness overrides partisanship.\n\n4. **Medicaid expansion is paramount** - P2 mentioned it multiple times. This is tangible policy that would transform the region.\n\n5. **Turnout barriers are real** - Distance, ID requirements, dropped polling places. Rural vote suppression is effective.\n\n6. **Cynicism must be addressed** - \"Nothing ever changes\" is a barrier. Need to show that votes matter.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Williams:** 9\n- **Harrison:** 0\n\nEnthusiasm is lower than Atlanta (averaging ~7/10) but unanimous.\n\n### Rural-Specific Insights\n\n- **Farm policy matters** - Black farmers, peanut program, land access - specific issues that need addressing\n- **Healthcare is existential** - Sole hospital, no Medicaid expansion, long distances to care\n- **Transportation determines access** - Everything from voting to healthcare to jobs depends on having a car\n- **\"Dollar General economy\"** - Phrase captures the lack of real employment opportunities\n- **Church infrastructure is essential** - Only reliable mobilization mechanism in rural areas\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I have a college degree and I manage a Dollar General. That's the economy here.\" - P4\n\n> \"We're the third generation on this land and I worry about passing it on.\" - P1\n\n> \"People die in that gap\" - P2 (on 2-hour drive to specialized care)\n\n> \"I'm Republican-leaning but I can't vote for Harrison. He's not qualified.\" - P3\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Peachtree Research Group*\n*September 27, 2022*\n"
