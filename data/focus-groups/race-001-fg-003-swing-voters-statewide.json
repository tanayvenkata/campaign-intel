    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Geographic diversity reveals shared economic anxiety** - From rural Lenawee to urban Flint to tourist Traverse City, cost of living dominates. The squeeze is universal even if the specifics differ.\n\n2. **Specificity dramatically improves message reception** - Generic \"fight for working families\" scored 3.5/5. Add specific numbers ($200, $35) and it jumps to 4.0/5. This pattern held throughout.\n\n3. **Negative attacks universally rejected** - Statement E (pure attack) scored 2.0/5. Even voters open to the critique wanted affirmative vision. Attack fatigue is real.\n\n4. **AG record is the strongest asset** - Statement F (AG accomplishments) scored highest at 4.1/5. Flint especially resonates beyond just Flint voters as proof she delivers.\n\n5. **Abortion freedom framing works broadly** - Even P6 (retired cop, traditional) could \"live with\" the freedom framing. P9 (lifelong Republican) is reconsidering her vote. This is a realignment issue.\n\n6. **Infrastructure is visceral in affected communities** - P8 and P9 represent communities traumatized by infrastructure failure. \"Never another Flint or Midland\" is powerful.\n\n7. **Rural Michigan is reachable** - P2 (farmer, Republican) expressed openness. Rural-specific messaging (broadband, roads, farm economy) could move voters typically written off.\n\n### Highest Scoring Messages\n\n1. Infrastructure commitment: 4.2/5\n2. AG record with Flint: 4.1/5\n3. Abortion freedom: 4.1/5\n4. Specific economic policies ($35 insulin, gas tax): 4.0/5\n5. Biography: 3.8/5\n\n### Lowest Scoring Messages\n\n1. Economic triumphalism: 1.7/5\n2. Pure negative attack: 2.0/5\n\n### Surprising Moments\n\n- **P2 (farmer, Republican) open to Holloway** - \"Never thought I'd say that.\" Rural outreach could work.\n\n- **P9 (lifelong Republican, Midland) moving on abortion** - Infrastructure AND abortion creating double persuasion effect.\n\n- **P8's emotional response to Flint mention** - AG record is deeply meaningful to affected communities. Authenticity breakthrough.\n\n- **Negative attacks utterly rejected** - Even voters who had criticisms of Vanderberg wanted positive vision, not attacks.\n\n### Regional Patterns\n\n- **Southeast (Macomb, Oakland, Ann Arbor):** Economic + abortion dual priority\n- **Mid-Michigan (Saginaw, Midland, Flint):** Infrastructure + trust issues, recovery-focused\n- **West (Holland, Kalamazoo):** Traditional values in flux, abortion shifting alignments\n- **North (Traverse City):** Tourism economy fragile, housing crisis acute\n- **Rural (Lenawee):** Farm economy stressed, infrastructure needs, reachable\n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n1. **Lead with specific economic policies** - Numbers beat slogans every time with this audience.\n\n2. **Integrate AG record throughout** - Don't just mention Flint once. Use it as proof point for every promise.\n\n3. **Infrastructure message can reach rural and urban** - Unifying theme across geographies.\n\n4. **Abortion as freedom** - Test message holds statewide including in conservative areas.\n\n5. **Avoid pure negative messaging** - Contrast is fine but must include affirmative vision.\n\n6. **Develop rural outreach** - Farm economy specifics, broadband, rural roads. Don't cede territory.\n\n---\n\n## Verbatim Quotes to Flag for Campaign\n\n> \"She actually did something about Flint. That means something to me.
