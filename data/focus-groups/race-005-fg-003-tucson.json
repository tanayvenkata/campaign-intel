    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Water is the defining issue for Tucson** - Not just environmentalists. P1, P5, P7 all see it as existential. Mitchell's climate denial is disqualifying.\n\n2. **Base wants bold, not just \"not crazy\"** - Multiple participants (P3, P10) want positive vision, not just contrast with Mitchell.\n\n3. **Dobbs activated women** - P9, P2 explicitly cite abortion as mobilizing force. Clear messaging demanded.\n\n4. **Tucson identity matters** - Reyes being from Tucson resonates. \"One of us\" feeling.\n\n5. **Enthusiasm high but fragile** - Fatigue from constant crisis elections. Need to sustain energy.\n\n6. **Progressives want to be excited** - \"Give us a reason to be excited, not just scared\" - key sentiment.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Reyes:** 10\n\n100% unanimous support but with varying enthusiasm about HOW she's running.\n\n### Base Mobilization Recommendations\n\n1. **Lead with water policy** - Specific, detailed, serious. This audience will respond.\n2. **Bold abortion stance** - Unambiguous pro-choice messaging.\n3. **Address fatigue** - Acknowledge the exhaustion while making case for engagement.\n4. **Positive vision** - Not just \"I'm not Mitchell\" - what is Arizona becoming?\n5. **Tucson identity** - Lean into hometown connection.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"We have maybe 20 years at current usage before catastrophe.\" - P1\n\n> \"Give progressives a reason to be excited, not just scared.\" - P3\n\n> \"Even Republicans in rural Arizona know the water is disappearing.\" - P5\n\n> \"She's a fascist. I don't use that word lightly.\" - P3\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Desert Research Partners*\n*October 4, 2022*\n"
