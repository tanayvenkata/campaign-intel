    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Unanimous support but varying enthusiasm** - All 10 voting Williams, but enthusiasm ranges from 7-10. Economic concerns temper some enthusiasm.\n\n2. **Church infrastructure is crucial** - Multiple participants mentioned church mobilization as key to turnout.\n\n3. **Harrison seen as insulting** - Not just unqualified but \"offensive\" - a cynical assumption that Black voters will vote for any Black candidate.\n\n4. **Voting rights anxiety is real** - The 2021 voting law changes are on everyone's mind. Turnout barriers are understood as intentional.\n\n5. **2020 coalition holding but tired** - The coalition that delivered Georgia is intact but fatigued. Can't take turnout for granted.\n\n6. **Williams' pastoral identity resonates deeply** - In a community where church matters, his moral authority is powerful.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Williams:** 10\n- **Harrison:** 0\n\nAverage enthusiasm: 9.0/10 - High but not uniform.\n\n### Turnout Recommendations\n\n1. **Church partnership is essential** - Souls to the Polls, pastor engagement, church van programs\n2. **Address economic concerns** - Don't just talk values; talk jobs, prices, healthcare\n3. **Combat cynicism directly** - Show how votes translated to policy wins\n4. **Youth-to-youth organizing** - P10's point about peer mobilization\n5. **Logistical support** - Transportation, voter protection, confusion-busting\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"They picked him because he was famous. Not because he was qualified. It's cynical.\" - P1\n\n> \"It's actually offensive. Like they think we'll vote for any Black face.\" - P10\n\n> \"I didn't march all those years to stay home now.\" - P6\n\n> \"What you see is what you get.\" - P9 (on Williams)\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Peachtree Research Group*\n*September 23, 2022*\n"
