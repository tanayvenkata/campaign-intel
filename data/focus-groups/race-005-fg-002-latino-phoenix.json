    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Identity matters but isn't sufficient** - Reyes' Latina identity is meaningful, especially for women and younger voters, but persuadable voters (P4, P6) want policy substance.\n\n2. **Election defense is powerful** - The 2020 certification message is the strongest across all participants. Even P4 (persuadable) was moved.\n\n3. **Border is nuanced** - Latino voters aren't uniformly \"pro-immigration.\" P4's perspective reflects real complexity. Don't assume.\n\n4. **Mitchell seen as genuine threat** - Not just opponent but existential threat to community. Language like \"invasion\" is felt personally.\n\n5. **Turnout infrastructure needed** - Registration gaps, information gaps, cynicism. Organization matters.\n\n6. **Economic message needed too** - Can't run only on identity and democracy. Kitchen table issues resonate.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Reyes:** 9\n- **Leaning Reyes:** 1\n\nAverage turnout likelihood: 9.5/10 - Very high engagement\n\n### Persuadable Profile (P4)\n\n- **Demographics:** Male, 45, small business owner, border community ties\n- **Concerns:** Border security, business environment, skeptical of Democrats on immigration\n- **Moved by:** Election defense message, economic substance\n- **Message:** Don't take Latino businessmen for granted; they're persuadable to GOP on border\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"She defended our votes in 2020. That took courage.\" - P1\n\n> \"When my kids see a Latina governor, that changes what they think is possible.\" - P7\n\n> \"She'd throw out my vote because she didn't like the result? No.\" - P8\n\n> \"Neither party actually fixes [the border].\" - P2\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Southwest Research Partners*\n*September 29, 2022*\n"
