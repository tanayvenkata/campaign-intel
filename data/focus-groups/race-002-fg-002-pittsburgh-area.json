    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Economic pressure is universal** - Every participant, from $17/hour service workers to $85K steelworkers, feels squeezed. The \"running to stay in place\" metaphor is powerful.\n\n2. **Union identity remains strong** - This is a union-proud room. Endorsements matter, union values shape political thinking, even among those with some cross-pressures.\n\n3. **Marchetti's background is perfect fit** - Working-class Scranton roots, steel family, showing up at union events. He's \"one of us\" without having to prove it.\n\n4. **Thornton's wealth is fatal liability** - \"Hedge fund guy,\" \"billionaire,\" \"betting against America\" - every mention of his background drew negative reaction.\n\n5. **Social Security/Medicare is non-negotiable** - The strongest reactions came on retirement security. This is life and death for these voters.\n\n6. **Class consciousness is alive** - \"Wall Street billionaires write the rules,\" \"guys like him profited from destroying our communities\" - there's genuine class awareness here.\n\n7. **Abortion is mobilizing even this demographic** - Surprised by engagement on reproductive rights. Union values extend to bodily autonomy.\n\n### Strongest Messages\n\n1. **\"Don't let Wall Street billionaires write the rules\"** - Unanimous enthusiasm\n2. **Social Security/Medicare protection** - Existential issue for older participants\n3. **\"Made his fortune betting against American companies\"** - Devastating framing if accurate\n\n### Participant Unanimity\n\nAll 10 participants committed to Marchetti. This is a 10-0 room. The question isn't who wins these voters but whether they turn out and bring friends.\n\n### Union-Specific Insights\n\n- **Endorsements still matter** but aren't automatic - members want to see candidates earn it\n- **\"Democrats took us for granted\"** (P8) - real grievance that needs addressing\n- **\"Jobs of the future\"** framing is important - unions understand they need to evolve\n- **UPMC non-union status** (P7) is a regional sore point - organizing hospitals is local issue\n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n1. **Schedule Mon Valley events** - This is base territory. Show up, fire them up, turn them out.\n2. **Social Security ads in heavy rotation** - \"Thornton wants to cut your benefits\" is devastating.\n3. **Labor Day visibility** - Major events in Pittsburgh area, Marchetti should be everywhere.\n4. **Transit workers outreach** - P8's ask is real. Public transit matters in Allegheny County.\n5. **\"Betting against America\" fact-check** - If Thornton's hedge fund shorted American companies, document it.\n\n### Verbatim Quotes for Campaign\n\n> \"What does he know about working for a living?\" - P1 (on Thornton)\n\n> \"His family is just like ours - working people who built this state.\" - P10 (on Marchetti)\n\n> \"You touch my Social Security, you lose my vote. Period.\" - P5\n\n> \"Hedge funds are parasites. They don't build anything. They just extract value.\" - P3\n\n> \"One guy's family built things. The other guy's family profited from tearing things down.\" - P7\n\n> \"I considered Thornton for about five minutes. No way I'm voting for a billionaire hedge fund guy.\" - P6\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Steel City Research Partners*\n*September 20, 2022*\n"
