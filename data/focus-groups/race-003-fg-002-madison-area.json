    "full_text": "\n### CRITICAL WARNING: BASE ENTHUSIASM DEFICIT\n\n**This focus group reveals serious problems in Democratic base territory.**\n\n1. **Enthusiasm average of 5.6/10** - In Dane County, the most Democratic county in Wisconsin, this should be 8+. This is a crisis.\n\n2. **P8 may not vote** - \"I might not vote\" from a 2020 voter in Madison is an alarming data point.\n\n3. **Economic messaging is failing even with Democrats** - \"Corporate greed\" scored 2.3/5 with BASE voters. If it doesn't work here, it doesn't work anywhere.\n\n4. **Burnout is pervasive** - \"Exhausted,\" \"tired,\" \"burnt out\" came up repeatedly. The coalition is fatigued.\n\n5. **Abortion is the only energy source** - 4.1/5 but campaign not leaning into it enough.\n\n6. **No ground game activation** - P2 (\"not doing doors\"), P7 (\"limited bandwidth\") - even reliable volunteers are sitting out.\n\n### Key Concerns Expressed by Base\n\n- Generic, stale messaging (\"same message for 30 years\")\n- No climate vision despite environmental voters\n- No criminal justice reform despite progressive base\n- Not differentiating from Biden/national Democratic brand\n- Playing it safe when boldness is needed\n\n### Participation Predictions\n\n- **Will definitely vote:** P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P9, P10 (7)\n- **Will probably vote:** P4, P7 (2)\n- **Might not vote:** P8 (1)\n\nIn the base, 10% considering not voting is a red flag.\n\n### Comparison to 2020\n\nMultiple participants noted reduced enthusiasm vs. 2020 and even 2018. In a state decided by <1%, this enthusiasm gap could be decisive.\n\n### Urgent Recommendations\n\n1. **Flood the zone with abortion messaging** - Only energy source. Use it.\n\n2. **Add climate message** - Environmental voters are natural allies feeling ignored.\n\n3. **Develop bold policy agenda** - Student debt, Medicare expansion, something that gives people hope.\n\n4. **Madison ground game activation** - Need personal contact to overcome fatigue.\n\n5. **Distance from Biden on inflation** - Acknowledge the problem. Don't dismiss it.\n\n6. **Give young people a reason** - P8's disengagement is symptomatic of larger problem.\n\n### Verbatim Quotes Showing Trouble\n\n> \"I'll vote for Kowalski obviously, but I'm tired.\" - P1\n\n> \"I might vote? I haven't decided.\" - P8\n\n> \"This messaging was stale in 2010. It's beyond stale now.\" - P9\n\n> \"Generic Democrat. Doesn't speak to what I care about.\" - P4\n\n> \"If we lose this one, it's self-inflicted.\" - P1\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Capitol Research Associates*\n*September 21, 2022*\n*STATUS: WARNING - BASE ENTHUSIASM DEFICIT*\n"
