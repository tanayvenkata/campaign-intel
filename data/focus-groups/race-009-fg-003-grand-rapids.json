    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **West Michigan is genuinely competitive** - Not the safe Republican territory it once was.\n\n2. **Abortion is the swing issue** - P6 (traditionally Republican) moving to Kowalski because of DeGroot's position.\n\n3. **DeGroot's local identity helps but isn't decisive** - \"One of ours\" but not enough to overcome policy concerns.\n\n4. **Class framing works for Kowalski** - \"Workers vs. executives\" resonates with P7, P3, P8.\n\n5. **Traditional conservatives remain** - P1, P5 are solid DeGroot. Reformed/business base still exists.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Kowalski:** 5-6\n- **DeGroot:** 2-3\n- **Undecided:** 1-2\n\n### Swing Profile (P6)\n\n- 38, marketing director, East Grand Rapids, suburban mom\n- Traditional Republican lean but moving on abortion\n- Quote: \"No exceptions? No.\"\n- Key to suburban shift\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Abortion messaging continues** - It's working in suburbs\n2. **Don't write off West Michigan** - It's competitive\n3. **Economic class framing** - CEO vs. workers lands\n4. **DeGroot's local advantage is surmountable** - Policy matters more\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"I'm pro-life personally but no exceptions? No.\" - P6\n\n> \"She's from Flint. Does she understand West Michigan?\" - P1\n\n> \"Her vote affects my household.\" - P7 (on wife's abortion focus)\n\n> \"Grand Rapids used to be reliably Republican... That's shifting.\" - P1\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by West Michigan Research*\n*September 29, 2024*\n"
