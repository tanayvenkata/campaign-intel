    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Auto industry credentials matter** - Kowalski's working-class auto background resonates in Detroit suburbs, even with management types like P4.\n\n2. **P4 (Trump 2020) considering Kowalski** - \"Her family is auto. DeGroot is some consultant. What does he know about making cars?\"\n\n3. **Abortion remains salient** - Especially for women (P1, P9) but also family influence (P4's daughters).\n\n4. **DeGroot's CEO image is mixed** - Positive for P5/P8 (fiscal), negative for P2/P4 (worker skepticism).\n\n5. **Economic specificity wins** - \"10,000 jobs\" beats \"cut red tape.\"\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Kowalski:** 7 (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P9, plus P4 crossover)\n- **DeGroot:** 2 (P5, P8)\n- **Leaning Kowalski:** 1 (P10)\n\nStrong suburban performance.\n\n### Crossover Profile (P4)\n\n- Retired GM manager, Trump 2020, voting Kowalski for first time\n- Key: Auto industry identity > party identity\n- Quote: \"What does he know about making cars?\"\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"Her family is auto. DeGroot is some consultant from Grand Rapids.\" - P4\n\n> \"CEOs create jobs by cutting workers. I've seen it.\" - P4\n\n> \"My daughters care about [abortion]. I listen to them.\" - P4\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Oakland Research Partners*\n*September 21, 2024*\n"
