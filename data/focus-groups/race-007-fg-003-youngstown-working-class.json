    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes - CATASTROPHIC WARNING SIGNS\n\n1. **Working-class defection is real and deep** - P5 (union, voted Brennan twice before) is voting Stanton. P6 (warehouse) is gone. P7 is leaning away.\n\n2. **Lordstown is an open wound** - \"Fought and lost\" is the summary. Good intentions don't count when plants close.\n\n3. **\"Democrats had their chance\"** - This phrase repeated. Resentment is about party, not just Brennan.\n\n4. **Trump straight-ticket voting** - Presidential coattails will be significant. Stanton benefits from Trump turnout.\n\n5. **Enthusiasm among supporters is low** - Even P1 and P8 (voting Brennan) are defensive, not excited.\n\n6. **Economic messaging failing** - CHIPS Act, infrastructure - abstractions to people in immediate pain.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Brennan:** 3\n- **Leaning Brennan:** 1\n- **Stanton:** 3\n- **Leaning Stanton:** 1\n- **Undecided:** 2\n\nIn Mahoning Valley - historically Brennan's strongest region - he's at best tied.\n\n### Critical Defector Profile (P5)\n\n- **Background:** 41, construction, union member, voted Brennan twice, Trump 2020\n- **Why defecting:** \"His party left us behind.\" \"Democrats assume we'll vote for them.\" \"I'm done waiting.\"\n- **Quote:** \"Maybe the Republicans will be different. Probably not. But at least they're not taking us for granted.\"\n\n### P10: The Split-Ticket Possibility\n\n- **Background:** 60, former GM Lordstown, bitter\n- **Status:** May vote Trump/Brennan split. Key for Brennan survival.\n- **Quote:** \"I'm angry at everyone.\"\n\n### Recommendations (URGENT - RACE LIKELY LOST)\n\n1. **Acknowledge failure** - \"I fought and lost\" isn't enough. Need to say \"you deserved better.\"\n2. **Lordstown specifically** - Cannot avoid this. Must address directly.\n3. **Split-ticket message** - Target P10 types. \"Vote for Trump if you want but keep Tim fighting for you.\"\n4. **Show up NOW** - This was September. Valley feels abandoned.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"The Democrats had decades to help us. They didn't. They focused on the cities, on minorities, on college kids. We got nothing.\" - P5\n\n> \"Fought and lost. Lordstown is closed. Those are the facts.\" - P10\n\n> \"I'm done waiting for Democrats to remember we exist.\" - P5\n\n> \"You can't explain global economics to people losing their houses.\" - P8\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Mahoning Valley Research*\n*September 27, 2024*\n"
