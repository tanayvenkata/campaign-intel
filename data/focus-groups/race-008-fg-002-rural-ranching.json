    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes - CATASTROPHIC WARNING\n\n1. **Personal relationship isn't enough** - P1 has known Sullivan 30 years, Sullivan helped him personally. Still voting Hansen.\n\n2. **Party over person is complete** - \"I'm not voting FOR Hansen. I'm voting AGAINST Democrats.\"\n\n3. **Cultural disconnect is existential** - Guns, climate, immigration, \"they look down on us.\" Party brand is toxic.\n\n4. **\"Send a message\" logic** - P3: \"Montana isn't California.\" Participants want Democrats to lose Montana completely.\n\n5. **Low enthusiasm for both** - Hansen voters averaging 5.2. They don't WANT Hansen; they want NOT-Democrat.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sullivan:** 2\n- **Hansen:** 5\n- **Undecided:** 1\n\nIn rural Montana, among people who know Sullivan personally, he's losing 5-2. Race is unwinnable.\n\n### Critical Defector Profile (P1)\n\n- **Background:** 62, cattle rancher, 4,000 acres, known Sullivan 30 years\n- **Sullivan help:** \"Helped me personally with BLM issues, water rights\"\n- **Still defecting:** \"He's a Democrat. That's the concern.\"\n- **Quote:** \"Jack is a good man. But his party isn't.\"\n\n### The P4 Story\n\n- **Background:** 71, retired rancher, voted Sullivan three times\n- **Now:** Voting straight Republican for first time ever\n- **Quote:** \"It breaks my heart. Jack is a good man.\"\n\n### Recommendations (Limited Impact Expected)\n\n1. **Depoliticize completely** - Run as individual, not Democrat\n2. **Local validator blitz** - Ranchers, sheriffs, local figures\n3. **Accept rural loss** - Focus on winning margins in cities\n4. **Long-term party work** - This isn't a Sullivan problem. It's a Democrat problem.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"Jack is a good man. But his party isn't.\" - P1\n\n> \"I've voted for Jack three times. This time... I don't know.\" - P4\n\n> \"It's not about Jack. It's about sending a message.\" - P3\n\n> \"At some point, you are what you vote with.\" - P6\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Big Sky Research*\n*September 21, 2024*\n"
