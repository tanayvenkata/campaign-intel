    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes - WARNING SIGNS\n\n1. **Working-class defection is real** - P4 (steelworker, union, voted Brennan before) is moving to Stanton. This is catastrophic if representative.\n\n2. **\"What have you done lately?\"** - Auto bailout was 15 years ago. Message feels dated. Need contemporary wins.\n\n3. **Stanton's simplicity beats Brennan's complexity** - \"Cut taxes, bring jobs\" is easier to understand than infrastructure and CHIPS Act timelines.\n\n4. **Ohio is no longer a swing state** - P4's observation: \"We're red now.\" Trump coattails in presidential year are devastating.\n\n5. **Cultural issues are cutting Republican** - Immigration, crime, education. Brennan's economic focus isn't enough.\n\n6. **Enthusiasm problem** - Even Brennan supporters (P1, P3) are defensive, not excited.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Brennan:** 4\n- **Stanton:** 5\n- **Leaning Stanton:** 1\n\nThis is a LOSING focus group. 6-4 in favor of opponent among swing voters.\n\n### Critical Defector Profile (P4)\n\n- **Background:** 62, retired steelworker, union member, Polish-American, Parma\n- **Vote history:** Obama 2008, Obama 2012, Trump 2016, Trump 2020, Brennan previous Senate races\n- **Why defecting:** \"What's actually changed?\" Economic despair, party frustration\n- **Quote:** \"I don't blame Tim. I just wonder if it matters anymore.\"\n\n### Recommendations (URGENT)\n\n1. **Update economic message** - Auto bailout is ancient history. Need current wins, current plan.\n2. **Simplify** - Stanton's \"cut taxes, bring jobs\" beats complex policy explanations.\n3. **Address cultural issues** - Cannot cede crime, immigration, education entirely.\n4. **P4 is the race** - Working-class union voters defecting = loss.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"What's actually changed? Steel is still gone. Jobs are still leaving.\" - P4\n\n> \"The Democrats abandoned working people. They talk about pronouns and climate while our towns die.\" - P2\n\n> \"He's saying things that make sense on the economy. Even if he's full of it, at least he's saying them.\" - P4\n\n> \"We're not a swing state anymore. We're red now.\" - P4\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Cleveland Research Partners*\n*September 19, 2024*\n"
