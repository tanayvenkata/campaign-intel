    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes - WARNING SIGNS\n\n1. **P7 defection is critical** - Conservative who voted Sullivan three times is moving to Hansen. \"I can't believe I'm saying it.\"\n\n2. **Nationalization is winning** - 5 of 10 said party matters more than candidate. Sullivan's personal brand can't overcome.\n\n3. **\"San Francisco values\" attack is working** - Even those who reject it acknowledge it's effective.\n\n4. **Enthusiasm gap among supporters** - Sullivan voters averaging 5.8. P7 (defector) at 3 on Hansen.\n\n5. **Transplant tension** - P6 represents coastal refugees. Valuable votes but also symbol of what conservatives resent.\n\n6. **Fatigue factor** - P8: \"I'm tired of all of it.\" Low-information voters may just stay home or go with the wave.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sullivan:** 5\n- **Leaning Sullivan:** 2\n- **Hansen:** 3\n\nThis is better than statewide polling but enthusiasm is too low.\n\n### Critical Defector Profile (P7)\n\n- **Background:** 41, rancher, conservative, voted Sullivan three times before\n- **Why defecting:** \"Trump's going to carry Montana by 20 points. Maybe it's time to have both senators on the same team.\"\n- **Enthusiasm:** 3 for Hansen - voting against party, not for candidate\n- **Quote:** \"I like Jack personally. But the party thing is getting harder to overlook.\"\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Depoliticize** - Run against Washington, not as Democrat\n2. **Local stories** - Constituent service moments, not policy debates\n3. **Public lands heavily** - Cross-partisan issue that matters here\n4. **Split-ticket permission** - \"Vote for whoever for president but keep Jack working for Montana\"\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Big Sky Research*\n*September 16, 2024*\n"
