    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **NEPA feels forgotten** - \"Politicians come for photo ops, then forget us.\"\n\n2. **Economic anxiety is deep** - Coal gone, factories gone, warehouses aren't the same.\n\n3. **Hartley's pharma background helps Russo** - \"Charging $500 for insulin\" is the frame.\n\n4. **Some voters are genuinely swing** - P3 and P5 are persuadable. Economic message matters.\n\n5. **Low enthusiasm is problem** - 5.7 average is concerning for turnout.\n\n6. **Italian-American connection transfers** - Russo's background resonates even from Pittsburgh.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Russo:** 7\n- **Undecided lean Russo:** 2\n- **Undecided lean Hartley:** 1\n\nGood but not locked down.\n\n### Swing Profiles\n\n- **P3 (35, warehouse worker, Trump 2020):** \"Democrats call us racist. Why would I vote for them?\"\n- **P5 (44, trucker, Teamsters):** \"Whoever makes my life easier.\"\n\n### Turnout Concern\n\nAverage enthusiasm 5.7 means GOTV is critical. Low-enthusiasm voters may stay home.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Physical presence** - \"Come here. A lot.\"\n2. **Economic specifics** - Not just rhetoric\n3. **Address cultural alienation** - P3's \"deplorable\" comment shows lasting damage\n4. **Italian-American messaging** - Helps bridge regional gap\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"Democrats stopped talking about jobs. Started talking about other stuff.\" - P1\n\n> \"They call us racist, deplorable. Why would I vote for people who hate me?\" - P3\n\n> \"The party left us. We didn't leave it.\" - P8\n\n> \"Whoever wins, nothing changes here.\" - P5\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by NEPA Research Group*\n*October 1, 2024*\n"
