    "full_text": "\n### Key Themes\n\n1. **Class identity more than ethnic identity** - Sandoval's working-class background resonates more than just being Latina.\n\n2. **Cuban and business-owner persuadables exist** - P6 (Cuban, conservative) and P4/P8 (business focus) were persuadable. Ended with Sandoval but lower enthusiasm.\n\n3. **Prescott's business image collapses** - \"Non-union hotels\" is effective attack. Business-friendly doesn't mean worker-friendly.\n\n4. **Economic message must be specific** - \"Lower costs\" with concrete examples (insulin, prescriptions) worked better than abstract claims.\n\n5. **Not a monolith** - Puerto Rican, Cuban, Mexican, Salvadoran - different experiences, different politics, but converging on Sandoval.\n\n6. **Youth engagement is strong** - P10 at 9 enthusiasm and organizing friends. Good sign.\n\n### Vote Intent\n\n- **Sandoval:** 10\n- **Enthusiasm range:** 5-9 (average 7.4)\n\n### Persuadable Profiles\n\n- **P6 (Cuban, 55, conservative):** Ultimately came to Sandoval but 5 enthusiasm. Economic voter frustrated with both parties.\n- **P8 (Real estate, 32, moderate):** Business-focused, 5 enthusiasm. Needs economic growth messaging, not just protection.\n- **P4 (Restaurant owner, 41):** Business owner who came to Sandoval but at 6. Balance worker protection with business concerns.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Specific economic wins** - Name policies, show concrete benefits.\n2. **Working-class solidarity** - Her background is the message. Keep telling it.\n3. **Don't assume Latino vote** - Earn it with presence, policy, respect.\n4. **Cuban outreach** - Different messaging needed. Emphasize freedom, opportunity, anti-extremism.\n\n### Key Quotes\n\n> \"Her mother cleaned rooms at the Sands. She understands where we come from.\" - P3\n\n> \"Democrats assume we'll vote for them. That's arrogant.\" - P10\n\n> \"I want to support business-friendly candidates but not at the expense of my workers, my community.\" - P4\n\n> \"He sees us as cheap labor, not families.\" - P3\n\n---\n\n*Transcript prepared by Silver State Research*\n*October 1, 2022*\n"
